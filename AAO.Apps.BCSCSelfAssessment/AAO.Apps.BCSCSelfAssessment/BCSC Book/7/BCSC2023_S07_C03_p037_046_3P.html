			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Developmental defects of the orbit can manifest clinically at any time from conception &#173;until late life. Most significant congenital anomalies of the eye and orbit are apparent on prenatal ultrasonography. The more profound the abnormality, the &#173;earlier in development it occurred. Identifying the embryologic origin of the congenital malformation helps ophthalmologists understand and classify the physical changes in the patient.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If an anomaly is caused by a slowing or cessation of a normal stage of development, the resulting deformity can be considered a pure arrest.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In the examination of a child with an ocular or craniofacial malformation, the clinician should focus on carefully defining the severity of the defect and identifying associated changes. Some syndromes may have specific associated ocular changes or secondary ocular complications, such as exposure keratitis or strabismus related to orbital maldevelopment.</p>
				<p class="body-text">See Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for detailed discussion and illustrations of many of the topics covered in this chapter.</p>

			<p class="h1">Anophthalmia</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">True anophthalmia is defined as a total absence of tissues of the eye; it is classified into 3&#160;types. <span class="italic">Primary anophthalmia,</span> which is rare and usually bilateral, occurs when the primary optic vesicle fails to grow out from the ce&#173;re&#173;bral vesicle at the 2-mm stage of embryonic development. <span class="italic">Secondary anophthalmia</span> is rare and lethal and results from a gross abnormality in the anterior neural tube. <span class="italic">Consecutive anophthalmia</span> results from a secondary degeneration of the optic vesicle.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Because orbital development is partially dependent on the size and growth of the globe, the bones of the orbit and adnexal structures fail to develop and remain hypoplastic in anophthalmia. Intervention requires mea&#173;sures that address all &#173;these issues, not just the absent eye.</p>

			<p class="h1">Microphthalmia</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Microphthalmia is much more common than anophthalmia and is defined by the presence of a small eye with an axial length that is at least 2 standard deviations below the mean axial length for age. Microphthalmic eyes vary in size depending on the severity of the defect. Most infants with a unilateral small orbit (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-1">Fig&#160;3-1</span>) and no vis&#173;i&#173;ble eye have a microphthalmic globe. The defect may be isolated, or it may occur with a constellation of abnormalities as part of a well-&#173;defined syndrome. &#173;Because multiple ge&#173;ne&#173;tic pathogenic variants have been reported in anophthalmia/microphthalmia, microphthalmia is considered a developmental phenotype that results from several dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ge&#173;ne&#173;tic rearrangements.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Treatment of Anophthalmia/Microphthalmia</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All &#173;children with microphthalmia have hypoplastic orbits. &#173;Because most microphthalmic eyes have no potential for vision, treatment focuses on achieving a cosmetically acceptable appearance that is reasonably symmetric. Treatment begins shortly &#173;after birth and consists of socket expansion with progressively larger conformers, which are used &#173;until socket expansion is complete and the patient can be fitted with a prosthesis. Enucleation is usually not necessary for the fitting of a conformer or an ocular prosthesis and is ordinarily avoided &#173;because it may worsen the bony hypoplasia. Orbital volume may be augmented with autogenous tissue, such as a dermis-&#173;fat graft, or with a synthetic implant. When placed at an early age, a dermis-&#173;fat graft may grow with the child, resulting in progressive socket expansion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Craniofacial techniques have been used to reposition and resize the orbit in patients with severe microphthalmia or anophthalmia and in older &#173;children with previously untreated microphthalmia. Such repairs are complex, as noted in the following discussion of craniofacial clefting.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Microphthalmia with orbital cyst</span> results from failure of the choroidal fissure to close in the embryo (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-2">Fig&#160;3-2</span>). This condition is usually unilateral but may be bilateral. The presence of an orbital cyst may be beneficial for stimulating normal growth of the involved orbital bone and eyelids. In some cases, the orbital cyst may be removed to allow the fitting of an ocular prosthesis. When &#173;these conditions are bilateral, significant visual impairment can result. Prompt referral for low vision rehabilitation and early intervention should be initiated in infancy.</p>

			<p class="h1">Craniofacial Clefting and Syndromic Congenital <br />Craniofacial Anomalies</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top6">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Craniofacial clefts occur &#173;because of a developmental arrest or mechanical disruption of development. Etiologic theories include a failure of neural crest cell migration and a failure of fusion or movement of facial pro&#173;cesses. Facial clefts in the skeletal structures are distributed around the orbit and maxilla (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-3">Fig&#160;3-3</span>). Clefts in the soft tissues are most apparent around the eyelids and lips (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-4">Fig&#160;3-4</span>). Examples of clefting syndromes affecting the orbit and eyelids include forms of midline clefts with hypertelorism as well as craniofacial microsomia and oculo-&#173;auriculo-&#173;vertebral spectrum, which comprises oculo-&#173;auriculo-&#173;vertebral disorder, hemifacial microsomia (see Fig&#160;2-5), and Goldenhar syndrome (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-5">Fig&#160;3-5</span>). Mandibulofacial dysostosis (Treacher Collins syndrome) is another rare ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder characterized by distinctive craniofacial abnormalities (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-6">Fig&#160;3-6</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The bones of the skull or orbit may also have congenital clefts through which intracranial contents can herniate. &#173;These protruding contents can be the meninges <span class="italic">(meningocele),</span> brain tissue <span class="italic">(encephalocele),</span> or both meninges and brain tissue <span class="italic">(meningoencephalocele).</span> When &#173;these herniations involve the orbit, they most commonly pre&#173;sent anteriorly with a protrusion subcutaneously near the medial canthus or over the bridge of the nose. Straining or crying may increase the size of the mass, and the globe may be displaced temporally and inferolaterally. Such herniations less commonly move into the posterior orbit. However, when pre&#173;sent, &#173;these lesions may cause anterior displacement and pulsation of the globe. Intranasal extension may occur, causing life-&#173;threatening airway obstruction. Treatment is surgical and should be carried out in collaboration with neurosurgery and craniofacial surgery. Meningoceles and encephaloceles adjacent to the orbit are frequently associated with anomalies of the optic nerve head, such as morning glory disc anomaly.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Craniosynostosis can occur as an isolated abnormality or in conjunction with other anomalies as part of a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic syndrome. <span class="italic">Syndromic craniosynostosis</span> is the premature closure of 1 or more sutures in the bones of the skull and results in vari&#173;ous skeletal deformities, including orbital defects. Associated ophthalmic prob&#173;lems include strabismus, astigmatism, blepharoptosis, proptosis, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and amblyopia. Secondary intracranial hypertension can be a complication. Hypertelorism and proptosis are frequently observed in craniosynostosis syndromes such as craniofacial dysostosis (Crouzon syndrome; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-7">Fig&#160;3-7</span>) and acrocephalosyndactyly type 1 (Apert syndrome; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-8">Fig&#160;3-8</span>). Syndromic craniosynostosis is a genet&#173;ically heterogeneous disorder, with pathogenic variants identified in several genes, predominantly the fibroblast growth &#173;factor receptor genes.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The severe orbital and facial defects associated with craniofacial disorders can sometimes be improved with surgery. Bony and soft tissue reconstruction is generally necessary. Such operations are often staged and usually require a multidisciplinary approach.</p>

			<p class="h1">Congenital Orbital Tumors</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top7">
				<p class="h2-h1">Hamartomas and Choristomas</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Hamartomas</span> are anomalous growths of tissue consisting only of mature cells normally found at the involved site. Classic examples are infantile (capillary) hemangiomas and the characteristic lesions of neurofibromatosis. <span class="italic">Choristomas</span> are tissue anomalies characterized by types of cells not normally found at the involved site. Classic examples are dermoid cysts, epidermoid cysts, dermolipomas (lipodermoids), and teratomas. This chapter discusses only some of the choristomas; further discussion of &#173;these congenital and juvenile tumors can be found in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
				<p class="h3">Dermoid cyst</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dermoid and epidermoid cysts are among the most common benign orbital tumors diagnosed in &#173;children. &#173;These cysts are pre&#173;sent congenitally and enlarge progressively. The more superficial cysts usually become symptomatic in childhood, but deeper orbital dermoids may not become clinically evident &#173;until adulthood. <span class="italic">Dermoid cysts</span> are lined by keratinizing epithelium and contain dermal appendages, such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and contain an admixture of oil and keratin. In contrast, <span class="italic">epidermoid cysts</span> are lined by epidermis only and are usually filled with keratin; they do not contain dermal appendages.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Orbital dermoid cysts most commonly occur in the lateral brow, adjacent to the frontozygomatic suture (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-9">Fig 3-9A</span>); less often they may be found in the medial upper eyelid, adjacent to the frontoethmoidal suture. Dermoid cysts typically pre&#173;sent as palpable, smooth, painless oval masses that enlarge slowly. They may be freely mobile, or they may be fixed to periosteum at the under&#173;lying suture.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If the dermoid occurs in the temporal fossa, computed tomography (CT) is often indicated to rule out dumbbell-&#173;shaped expansion through the suture into the under&#173;lying orbit. A “dumbbell dermoid cyst” such as this can cause pulsating proptosis with mastication, a highly specific feature of this condition.</p>
				<p class="body-text">CT is also useful to evaluate medial lesions and to distinguish dermoids from congenital encephaloceles, dacryoceles, and vascular lesions that might also occur in this location. When viewed on a CT scan, an orbital dermoid cyst is typically well defined by an enhancing wall and a nonenhancing lumen (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;3-9B</span>). A partially calcified margin or rim is vis&#173;i&#173;ble in most cases. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the lesion is best appreciated on fat-&#173;suppression sequences and appears as a well-&#173;defined round or ovoid structure of variable size. Most dermoids are relatively hypointense with re&#173;spect to orbital fat on T1-&#173;weighted images and relatively hyperintense on T2-&#173;weighted images. Enhancement is minimal &#173;because of the lack of blood vessels in the cyst.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Dermoid cysts that do not pre&#173;sent &#173;until adulthood are often not palpable &#173;because they are situated posteriorly in the orbit, usually in the superior and temporal portions, adjacent to the bony sutures. The globe and adnexa may be displaced, causing progressive proptosis. Long-&#173;standing dermoid cysts may result in erosion or remodeling of the orbital bones. In some cases, the clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion may be of orbital inflammation, which is incited by leakage of oil and keratin from the cyst. Expansion of the dermoid cyst and inflammatory response to the leaked cyst contents may ultimately result in an orbitocutaneous fistula. A fistula may also occur &#173;after incomplete surgical removal.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Dermoid cysts are usually removed surgically (Figs&#160;3-9C, 3-9D; <span class="xref-video">Videos 3-1</span> and <span class="xref-video">3-2</span>). &#173;Because dermoid cysts that pre&#173;sent in childhood are often superficial, they can be excised through an incision placed in the upper eyelid crease or directly over the lesion. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the cyst wall should be maintained during surgery. Rupture of the cyst can lead to an acute inflammatory pro&#173;cess if part of the cyst wall or any of the contents remain within the eyelid or orbit. If the cyst wall is ruptured, the surgeon should remove the cyst contents. Complete surgical removal may be difficult if the cyst has leaked preoperatively and adhesions have developed.</p>

				<p class="h3">Dermolipoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dermolipomas (lipodermoids) are solid tumors that predominantly consist of mature adipose tissue and are usually located in and beneath the conjunctiva over the globe’s lateral surface. &#173;These benign lesions may have deep extensions that can abut the levator aponeurosis and/or extraocular muscles. Superficially, dermolipomas may have fine hairs that can be irritating to patients (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-10">Fig&#160;3-10</span>). &#173;These tumors typically require no treatment &#173;unless the lesion is large and/or cosmetically objectionable. In &#173;these cases, only the anterior, vis&#173;i&#173;ble portion should be excised; when pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the overlying conjunctiva should be preserved. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the lacrimal gland ducts, extraocular muscles, and the levator aponeurosis. Lesions that may simulate dermolipomas include prolapsed orbital fat, a prolapsed palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, and lymphoma—&#173;processes that are generally found only in adults.</p>
				<p class="h3">Teratoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Teratomas are rare tumors that arise from all 3 germinal layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and are usually cystic. On histologic examination, a teratoma is characterized by a complex arrangement of vari&#173;ous tissues, including clear cysts lined by &#173;either epidermis or gastrointestinal or respiratory epithelium, and islands of hyaline cartilage, ce&#173;re&#173;bral tissue, epidermal cysts, and choroid plexus are frequently found. A child with an orbital teratoma characteristically pre&#173;sents with severe unilateral proptosis at birth. Consequently, the globe and optic nerve may be maldeveloped. When the tumor is small, the globe is often normal. The proptosis may increase over the first few days or weeks of life, and compression of the globe can result in corneal exposure and vision loss. Resection can be performed to preserve ocular function. Although teratomas in other parts of the body have been known to undergo malignant transformation, &#173;those confined to the orbit are generally benign. However, exenteration may be necessary for &#173;those that are malignant.</p>

Lower eyelid colobomas may also be pre&#173;sent. Mandibular hypoplasia &#173;causes micrognathia with the characteristically small chin and lower jaw. Abnormalities of the external and &#173;middle ear are also found, manifesting as absent, small, or malformed ears and conductive hearing loss. <span class="figure-source-note">(Courtesy of Nicholas Mahoney, MD.)</span></p>
