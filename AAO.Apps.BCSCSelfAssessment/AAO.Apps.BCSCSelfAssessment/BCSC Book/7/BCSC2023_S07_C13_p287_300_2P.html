			<p class="h1">Pathogenesis of the Aging Face</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An individual’s facial contours and appearance are derived from soft tissue draped over under&#173;lying bone. The soft-&#173;tissue component consists of skin, subcutaneous fat, muscle, deeper fat pads, and fascial layers. The under&#173;lying structural ele&#173;ment is composed of bone, cartilage, and teeth.</p>
				<p class="body-text">As the face ages, the soft-&#173;tissue component descends, and the bone component loses mass. With &#173;these changes, relatively more soft tissue hangs from its attachments to the bone. Loss of subcutaneous fat, skin atrophy, and descent of facial fat pads compound this facial sagging. Around the eyes, the lateral brow typically descends more than the medial brow, which leads to temporal hooding. The orbital septum attenuates, allowing fat to prolapse forward. In the lower eyelid, midface descent produces the skeletonization of the infraorbital rim and increases the prominence of the orbital fat. Sagging of the platysma muscle in the neck posterior to the mandibular ligament gives rise to jowling (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-1">Fig&#160;13-1</span>).</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Physical Examination of the Aging Face</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Much of the surgeon’s appraisal of the aging face can be performed through close observation during the introduction and history phase of the initial meeting. The surgeon should observe the patient’s hairstyle, including the presence or absence of bangs, hair thickness, and the height of the hairline; the use of the frontalis; the position of the brow; the texture and quality of the facial skin; and the presence and location of rhytids, telangiectasias, pigmentary dyschromia, and expressive furrows. As a part of the assessment, the physician should be mindful of the patient’s expectations and &#173;whether they can be met with &#173;either a minimally invasive procedure or surgery.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If chemical peeling or &#173;laser skin resurfacing is being considered, the surgeon should also note the patient’s Fitzpatrick skin type, which affects the skin’s response to &#173;these procedures. The Fitzpatrick scale classifies skin into 6 types according to skin color (before sun exposure) and the reaction of the skin to sun exposure. The higher the number is, the greater the amount of skin pigment. Thus, Fitzpatrick type I refers to fair skin with minimal pigmentation, and type VI represents skin with marked pigmentation.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In addition, the surgeon should assess eyelid skin and fat along with eyelid margin position relative to the pupil and cornea, presence or absence of horizontal lower eyelid laxity, midface and chin position, presence of jowling, and accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the neck, noting any nasal deformities (tip descent or broadening) or thinning of the lips. The surgeon may find a side view of the neck to be particularly helpful in determining the extent of aging. Preoperative photo&#173;graphs should be available in the operating room.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Nonsurgical Facial Rejuvenation</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonsurgical facial rejuvenation techniques such as &#173;laser resurfacing, soft-&#173;tissue dermal fillers, neurotoxin injection, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion are used to treat involutional and actinic facial skin changes. &#173;These superficial procedures may precede or be combined with surgical procedures that reposition deeper structures. It is impor&#173;tant to remember that the upper eyelid appearance is inextricably linked to the position of the eyebrow. Similarly, the lower eyelid appearance is linked to the position of the midface, as well as the lower face and neck. Subunits of the facial cosmetic superstructure should not be viewed or manipulated individually but must be addressed in the context of the entire face and neck.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Chemical Peels</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chemical skin resurfacing has been used since the 1800s to treat melasma and other dermatologic disorders of pigmentation. Chemical peels are categorized based on the depth of action of treatment. Superficial peels, such as glycolic acid, a type of alpha-&#173;hydroxy acid (AHA), work by exfoliating epidermal layers but stop at the basal layer. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is a medium-&#173;depth peeling agent that destroys the cells in the epidermis and dermis, depending on its concentration. New keratinocytes are expected to replace the abnormal cells and stimulate new collagen production. Both superficial and medium-&#173;depth peels are used for the treatment of pigmentary disorders as well as signs of photoaging, including fine lines and wrinkles. Deep chemical peels ablate the epidermis and dermis and are generally accomplished with high-&#173;concentration TCA (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>50%) and phenol for pigmentary disorders and scars. It is impor&#173;tant that the physician consider the Fitzpatrick skin type when choosing the depth of peeling, &#173;because skin types with higher numbers may run the risk of further hyperpigmentation with deeper peels.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">&#173;Laser Skin Resurfacing</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Laser skin resurfacing is designed to reduce wrinkles and enhance the texture and appearance of the facial and periorbital skin. A variety of &#173;lasers have been developed to perform &#173;laser resurfacing; superpulsed or ultrapulsed carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) and erbium:yttrium-&#173;aluminum-&#173;garnet (Er:YAG) &#173;lasers are the most widely used. Traditional ablative &#173;lasers remove the entire epidermis, resulting in longer postprocedural erythema, whereas fractional ablative &#173;lasers remove less than 60% of the epidermis by creating microablated columns (MACs) with interspersed areas of untouched epithelium that promote faster re-&#173;epithelialization and decreased postprocedural erythema. Accordingly, the development of superpulsed CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> &#173;lasers has allowed ablative skin resurfacing without excessive thermal damage. Superpulsed and ultrapulsed CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> &#173;lasers deliver small pulses of high-&#173;energy light to the skin; pauses between &#173;these pulses allow cooling of the tissues in the treated area, minimizing the risk of thermal damage. The Er:YAG &#173;laser has a nearly pure ablative effect on collagen-&#173; and water-&#173;containing tissues, with a much smaller zone of thermal injury and much less heat transfer into tissue than the CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> &#173;lasers.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Laser resurfacing is a useful adjunct to lower blepharoplasty, face-&#173;lifts, and neck-&#173;lifts. The skin-&#173;shrinking, collagen-&#173;tightening effect of &#173;laser skin resurfacing often allows the surgeon to avoid making an external incision and removing skin. It can also be useful in the management of scars and festoons and facilitate postoperative healing.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Patient se&#173;lection is vital for successful &#173;laser skin resurfacing. Patients with a fair complexion and generally healthy, well-&#173;hydrated skin are ideal candidates. Patients with greater degrees of skin pigmentation can be safely treated, but care and caution are needed. The darker the skin pigmentation is, the greater the risk of postoperative inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Contraindications include inappropriate, unrealistic expectations, the presence of collagen vascular disease such as active systemic lupus erythematosus, and significant uncorrected lower eyelid laxity.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Herpes simplex virus infection &#173;after &#173;laser resurfacing may lead to scarring; therefore, most surgeons prophylactically treat patients with suppressing doses of antiviral agents against outbreaks of herpes simplex virus. Other complications associated with &#173;laser skin resurfacing include a variety of ophthalmic prob&#173;lems such as lagophthalmos, exposure keratitis, corneal injury, ectropion, and lower eyelid retraction.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A desire to improve superficial skin characteristics and facial wrinkling without the prolonged period of healing and erythema seen with ablative &#173;laser skin resurfacing has led to the development of devices that use fractionated &#173;lasers, intense pulsed light, ultrasound, or radiofrequency to deliver energy to the skin. &#173;These modalities can potentially even skin tone, remove cutaneous dyschromias or fine wrinkles, and even lift and smooth facial tissues. Each of &#173;these devices has its own risks and limitations but offers some improvement in aspects of facial aging, with fewer risks and shorter recovery times than with ablative &#173;laser skin resurfacing.</p>
				<p class="h2">Cosmetic Uses of Botulinum Toxin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of botulinum toxin in patients with benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm (HFS) led to the observation that botulinum toxin reduces or eliminates some facial wrinkles. The first neurotoxin available for aesthetic indications was onabotulinumtoxinA. The FDA approved it to temporarily reduce wrinkles in the glabellar area and forehead and to diminish the appearance of the lateral canthal lines (crow’s-&#173;feet). AbobotulinumtoxinA, the second neurotoxin to become available in the United States, has also been approved for the treatment of wrinkles in the glabellar area. IncobotulinumtoxinA has been approved for both cosmetic and medical applications, including blepharospasm; it is &#173;free of complexing protein, theoretically decreasing risk of sensitization, and can be stored at room temperature. A number of non–&#173;FDA-&#173;approved botulinum toxin products are available worldwide; however, US physicians should recognize the significant risks associated with using a non–&#173;FDA-&#173;approved substance for injection. Also, unit potency differs among &#173;these products, requiring that careful dosing adjustments be made.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Apart from the glabella, the areas most amenable to neuromodulation are the forehead, lateral canthal lines, perioral rhytids, and platysmal bands. The amount of botulinum toxin required and the location of injections vary significantly among patients and should be individualized.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The eyebrow can be chemically lifted when botulinum toxin is injected into the depressors of the eyebrow. The corners of the mouth can be elevated with injection into the depressor anguli oris muscle. The onset of action, peak effect, duration of effect, and complications of botulinum toxin for cosmetic purposes are the same as &#173;those noted for botulinum toxin as therapy for benign essential blepharospasm in Chapter&#160;12 of this volume.</p>
				<p class="h2">Soft-&#173;Tissue Dermal Fillers</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many formulations of fillers are available for nonsurgical facial rejuvenation. Hyaluronic acid fillers do not require allergy testing and have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of facial wrinkles or folds such as the nasolabial folds (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-2">Fig&#160;13-2</span>), for lip augmentation, and to correct age-&#173;related volume loss in the cheek area. Off-&#173;label usage of hyaluronic acid fillers for the periocular region (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-3">Fig&#160;13-3</span>) has been described extensively in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture, but &#173;these fillers must be used with care. Complications from intravascular injection, including regional soft-&#173;tissue necrosis and central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, have been reported. In central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, retrograde embolization follows inadvertent high-&#173;pressure injection into an artery (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>, Fig&#160;9-8). The nasal dorsum and glabella are two of the most vulnerable locations for filler injections that lead to vision loss. In cases of local or regional soft-&#173;tissue necrosis from filler injection, some physicians inject hyaluronidase and administer hyperbaric oxygen. &#173;There are no definitive therapies for reversal of vision loss. Nonhyaluronic acid fillers, including &#173;those comprised of calcium hydroxylapatite and poly-&#173;L-&#173;lactic acid, are sometimes employed to promote collagen production and volume augmentation, but &#173;these also carry risk of intravascular complications and nodule formation; for &#173;these reasons and &#173;because &#173;there is no agent that reverses the effects of &#173;these fillers, proper training and experience are necessary for their administration.</p>
				<p class="h2">Autologous Fat Grafting</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the advent of liposuction and refinements in the technique, this procedure has evolved into a safe and predictable means of restoring facial volume. Its biocompatibility makes fat a suitable filler. Any area treatable with the commercial dermal fillers discussed in the previous section is potentially treatable with fat grafting. &#173;These areas include, but are not &#173;limited to, the periocular area, &#173;temples, forehead, brow, cheeks, midface, lips, nasolabial fold, jawline, submental crease, and chin. As with commercial dermal filler injection, fat grafting carries the risk of intravascular injection. Additionally, fat grafts can exhibit variable growth, resorption, or palpability if injected too superficially.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Surgical Facial Rejuvenation</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Facial and eyelid surgery should be approached with care. Adequate preoperative preparation includes properly informing the patient of the proposed benefits as well as the potential complications of the procedure. Significant complications—&#173;including facial nerve paralysis, skin flap necrosis, and vision loss—&#173;are potential risks. It is impor&#173;tant to identify patients with unrealistic expectations and help provide counseling and resources for redirection.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Rejuvenation of the aging face requires a multitude of techniques. Chemical peeling, &#173;laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, and liposculpting can enhance the results of surgery, or, at times, may be preferred to incisional surgery.</p>
				<p class="h2">Lower Blepharoplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Satisfactory results &#173;after cosmetic lower eyelid surgery often require additional skin rejuvenation with skin removal, chemical peels, and/or &#173;laser resurfacing. In the preoperative discussion, the surgeon should clearly describe reasonable expectations for, as well as the risks of, the procedure. Patients should understand that aggressive resection of lower eyelid skin and fat may lead to eyelid retraction, ectropion, or a sunken, aged periorbital appearance. Preoperative examination for lower blepharoplasty includes testing of the elasticity (snapback test) and distractibility of the lower eyelid; the surgeon should be alert to the pos&#173;si&#173;ble need for horizontal tightening of the lower eyelids along with the blepharoplasty. Furthermore, prominent orbital rims, malar hypoplasia, relative exophthalmos, and the presence of festoons should be notated and discussed with the patient.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Lower blepharoplasty can be accomplished through a transconjunctival incision or a transcutaneous, infraciliary incision (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;13-1</span>). The <span class="italic">transconjunctival incision</span> offers a lower rate of postoperative eyelid retraction and absence of an external postoperative scar (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-4">Fig&#160;13-4</span>). The preoperative evaluation defines the location and extent of lower eyelid fat prolapse and thus determines the bound&#173;aries of surgical excision. The surgeon should be aware of the location of the inferior oblique muscle, which is between the medial and central fat pads. As in the upper eyelid, the medial fat pad of the lower eyelid is less yellow than the lateral fat pads. The central fat compartment is separated from the lateral fat compartment by the arcuate expansion of the inferior oblique muscle; removal or incision of this arcuate expansion may improve access to the lateral fat pad. The surgeon can remove or reposition the fat. Horizontal tightening or resuspension (see Chapter 12, <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-2</span>) is often performed with lower blepharoplasty.</p>

				<p class="body-text">&#173;After structural alteration of the lower eyelid (eg, fat removal, fat transposition, midface resuspension, horizontal eyelid tightening), skin removal can be performed. When skin resection is necessary, an <span class="italic">infraciliary incision</span> is used to remove only the skin while preserving the under&#173;lying pretarsal orbicularis muscle. It is impor&#173;tant to note that aggressive skin removal during lower blepharoplasty increases the risk of lower eyelid contour abnormalities, retraction, and ectropion. This risk can be minimized with conservative skin removal and lower eyelid tightening.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Patients should be observed for orbital hemorrhage and managed as quickly as pos&#173;si&#173;ble (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>). Diplopia<span class="italic">,</span> another serious complication of blepharoplasty, may result from injury to the inferior oblique, inferior rectus, or superior oblique muscle. The inferior oblique muscle originates in the anterior orbital floor lateral to the lacrimal sac and travels posterolaterally within the lower eyelid retractors. It separates the central and medial fat pads of the lower eyelid and, thus, may be injured during removal of fat or inadvertently sutured to the inferior orbital rim during fat redraping procedures in lower blepharoplasty. In upper blepharoplasty, the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle may be damaged by deep dissection of orbital fat in the superonasal quadrant of the upper eyelid.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Forehead Rejuvenation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endoscopic techniques allow the surgeon to raise the brow and rejuvenate the forehead <span class="italic">( foreheadplasty)</span> through small incisions approximately 1&#160;cm (though incisions may vary) &#173;behind the hairline (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-5">Fig&#160;13-5).</span> Dissection is accomplished with an endoscopic periosteal elevator and blunt dissectors. Key steps are the creation of the incisions, creation of an optical cavity, periosteal release at the orbital rim, and fixation of the elevated flap. The forehead can be fixated using a drilled bone tunnel through the calvarium, resorbable anchors, or fixation screws. The advantages of the endoscopic technique are smaller incisions hidden within the hair, elevation of a lower hairline (short forehead), customized lifting of specific segments of the brow, and faster recovery (relative to pretrichial brow-&#173;lift) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-6">Fig&#160;13-6</span>). The disadvantages include the need for endoscopic equipment, risk of damage to the facial nerve, possibility of alopecia around scalp incisions, and skin changes related to the fixation technique used.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The pretrichial approach is used in patients who have a high hairline. Access is gained through a hairline incision (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-7">Fig&#160;13-7</span>) instead of the small skin incisions used with the endoscopic approach. Dissection is performed in the subcutaneous layer. An appropriate amount of forehead skin is resected, and the under&#173;lying frontalis and galea are plicated with a subsequent layered closure. The advantages of the pretrichial technique are power&#173;ful lifting of the brow without elevation of the hairline and that &#173;there is no need for endoscopic equipment. The disadvantages are a relatively high incidence of postoperative sensory paresthesias and a vis&#173;i&#173;ble scar line.</p>
				<p class="h2">Midface Rejuvenation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The entire midface should be evaluated in a patient presenting for lower eyelid blepharoplasty. With age, cheek tissue descends and orbital fat herniates, creating a double-&#173;convexity deformity (see <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-4">Fig&#160;13-4&#160;A, B</span>). Attenuation of the orbitomalar, masseteric cutaneous, and zygomatic ligaments are the pathologic changes that occur with midfacial ptosis. Elevation of the suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) and midface, combined with conservative fat removal or re&#173;distribution, can restore the youthful anterior projection of the midface. This can also be achieved with dermal filler in more subtle cases and with a surgical cheek implant in cases of significant cheek descent.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Midface elevation can be achieved through a preperiosteal or subperiosteal approach. The preperiosteal plane can be accessed through the lower eyelid, with or without release of the lateral canthal tendon, or by using the temporal scalp incision employed in an endoscopic forehead-&#173;lift. The subperiosteal midface can also be accessed through &#173;these incisions or through a superior gingival sulcus incision (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-8">Fig&#160;13-8</span>). The goal of &#173;these procedures is to provide release of the midface tissues, followed by elevation and resuspension. Midface elevation is commonly combined with additional procedures such as a brow-&#173;lift, lower face-&#173;lift, or volume augmentation.</p>
				<p class="h2">Lower Face and Neck Rejuvenation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During preoperative evaluation, the face and neck should be considered as a single cosmetic unit. Correction of the cosmetic subunits of the upper face and midface without addressing the lower face and neck can create an un&#173;balanced appearance. At the very least, &#173;these concerns must be discussed with the patient preoperatively, along with surgical options.</p>
				<p class="h3">Rhytidectomy</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most commonly performed procedures include the vintage (subcutaneous) rhytidectomy, the rhytidectomy with superficial elevation and refixation of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-9">Fig&#160;13-9</span>), and the deep-&#173;plane rhytidectomy. Rhytidectomies typically include surgical management of the jowls and neck, including liposuction with or without platysmaplasty (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-10">Fig&#160;13-10</span>). The 3 rhytidectomy procedures mentioned differ mainly in the location and extent of dissection. Although the more superficial procedures are less likely to cause facial nerve damage, they may produce shorter-&#173;lasting results. The more extensive procedures have greater risks (eg, facial nerve injury), but the likelihood that they &#173;will produce dramatic, longer-&#173;lasting improvement is also greater.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Complications of rhytidectomy are directly related to the extent of subcutaneous undermining; they include hematoma, seroma, skin necrosis, hair loss, paresthesias, motor deficits, incisional scarring, asymmetry, earlobe distraction (pixie-&#173;ear deformity), and contour irregularities. Hematoma is the leading surgical face-&#173;lift complication, but patient dissatisfaction may be the most common postoperative issue.</p>
				<p class="h3">Neck liposuction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neck liposuction enhances the neckline and is often performed in conjunction with other cosmetic procedures. Stab incisions, or <span class="italic">adits,</span> are made just posterior to the earlobe on each side and along the submental incision line; if liposuction is performed as a stand-&#173;alone procedure, they are made just anterior to the submental crease. Small liposuction cannulas are used for fat removal. A layer of fat is left on the dermis, and the liposuction cannula openings are always oriented away from the dermis to avoid injury to the vascular plexus deep to the dermis. In addition to abnormalities in skin quality, damage in this area can lead to unsightly scarring of the dermis of the under&#173;lying neck musculature. The adits are left open or sutured, and a compression ban&#173;dage is worn for 1 week &#173;after the procedure.</p>
				<p class="h3">Platysmaplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Platysmaplasty is performed to correct platysmal bands and is typically done in conjunction with a lower face-&#173;lift. A subcutaneous dissection is carried out in the preplatysmal plane centrally &#173;under the chin to the level of the thyroid cartilage (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-11">Fig&#160;13-11A</span>). Lateral platysmal undermining and suspension may be performed as part of a rhytidectomy. Midline platysma resection and reconstruction (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-11">Fig&#160;13-11B</span>) are performed if midline neck support is needed. A drain and a light compression dressing are placed. Postoperatively, the cervicomental &#173;angle is more acute, yielding a more youthful look.</p>
