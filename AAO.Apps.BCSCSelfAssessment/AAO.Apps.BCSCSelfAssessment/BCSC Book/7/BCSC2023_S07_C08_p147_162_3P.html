			<div id="Chapt8_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Certain conditions may require removal of an eye or the orbital contents in order to safeguard life, preserve vision in the fellow eye, or enhance comfort and cosmesis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The goals of anophthalmic socket surgery are</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">assuaging clinical symptoms (ie, resolution of pain or removal of an infectious source)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">assisting in clinical diagnosis when indicated (ie, pathological diagnosis for suspected intraocular malignancies)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">maximizing orbital implant volume with good centration within the orbit</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">achieving optimal eyelid contour, position, and tone</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">establishing adequately deep fornices to retain the prosthesis</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">transmitting motility from the implant to the overlying prosthesis</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">achieving symmetry</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The indications for anophthalmic surgery are diverse, and the procedure of choice varies. <span class="italic">Evisceration</span> is the removal of the cornea and intraocular contents (lens, uvea, ret&#173;ina, and vitreous) while leaving the sclera, extraocular muscles, and optic nerve intact. <span class="italic">Enucleation</span> involves removal of the entire globe while preserving the remaining orbital tissues. <span class="italic">Exenteration</span> refers to removal of the globe and some or all of the orbital tissues (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-1">Fig&#160;8-1</span>). The cosmetic goals in anophthalmic surgery are to minimize any condition that draws attention to the anophthalmia. Surgical efforts to produce orbital and eyelid symmetry and to promote good prosthetic position and motility enhance cosmesis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Congenital anophthalmia (absence of the globe), microphthalmia (diminished size of the globe), and their management are discussed in Chapter&#160;3&#160;of this volume. Management of infants with &#173;these disorders differs from management of adults with anophthalmia &#173;because of the opportunity for orbital and tissue expansion in infants. However, the princi&#173;ples of socket surgery described in this chapter may also be applied to pediatric management.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Loss of an eye may cause degraded self-&#173;image or depression. The ophthalmologist can assist patients both before and &#173;after surgery by providing reassurance and psychological support. Discussion of the procedure, the rehabilitation pro&#173;cess, and expected functional changes can help patients with adjustment. With very few exceptions, monocular patients may resume the full range of home, vocational, and recreational activities. When resuming full activity, patients should take a cautious approach to allow adjustment to the loss of some depth perception and visual field. This loss may result in occupational limitations. Routine prosthetic maintenance and regular follow-up with an ocularist is encouraged. One of the most impor&#173;tant roles for the ophthalmologist is to help safeguard the remaining eye through regular follow-up examinations and the prescription of polycarbonate safety glasses for full-&#173;time wear.</p>

			<p class="h1">Enucleation and Evisceration</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
				<p class="h2-h1">Evisceration</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evisceration involves the removal of the contents of the globe, with the sclera, extraocular muscles, and optic nerve left intact. Evisceration should be considered <span class="italic">only</span> if the presence of an intraocular malignancy has been ruled out; if no view of the posterior chamber is pos&#173;si&#173;ble, a B-&#173;scan ultrasound should be performed.</p>
				<p class="h3">Advantages of evisceration</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The advantages of evisceration include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Less disruption of orbital anatomy.</span> &#173;Because &#173;there is less dissection within the orbit, &#173;there is a lower chance of injury to the extraocular muscles and nerves and of iatrogenic fat atrophy. The relationships between the muscles, globe, eyelids, and fornices remain undisturbed.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">A simpler procedure.</span> Compared to enucleation, this procedure is faster and less invasive, and may be well suited to patients who have comorbidities, are prone to bleeding, or are overall poorer surgical candidates.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Easier prosthesis fitting by the ocularist.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h3">Disadvantages of evisceration</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The disadvantages of evisceration include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Not &#173;every patient is a candidate.</span> Evisceration should never be performed if a malignant ocular tumor is suspected. Severe phthisis bulbi limits the size of the orbital implant that can be placed. Patients with infectious scleritis or panophthalmitis, in which the infection has spread to involve the sclera, are not candidates &#173;unless the involved sclera can be completely removed.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Rare risk of sympathetic ophthalmia.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Less complete specimen for pathologic examination.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h2">Enucleation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enucleation involves releasing the extraocular muscles from the sclera, cutting the optic nerve, and removing the globe. Enucleation allows for complete histologic examination of the eye and optic nerve. It reduces the concern that surgery might contribute to the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia (discussed in the following paragraphs) in the fellow eye. Enucleation is the procedure of choice if the nature of the intraocular pathology is unknown or if an ocular tumor is suspected in an eye with no view of the posterior pole.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Enucleation is indicated for primary intraocular malignancies that are not amenable to alternative types of therapy. The ocular tumors that most commonly require enucleation are retinoblastoma and choroidal melanoma. When enucleation is performed on an eye with an intraocular tumor, the surgeon must take care to avoid penetrating the globe during surgery and to &#173;handle the globe &#173;gently to minimize the remote risk of disseminating tumor cells. In cases of suspected retinoblastoma, removing a long segment of optic nerve with the enucleation specimen increases the chance of complete resection of the tumor. Blind eyes with opaque media should be suspected of harboring an occult neoplasm &#173;unless another cause of ocular disease can be surmised. Ultrasonography is useful in evaluating and planning proper management of &#173;these eyes.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In severely traumatized eyes, early enucleation may be considered if the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia and harm to the remaining eye is judged to be greater than the likelihood of recovering useful vision in the traumatized eye. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be a delayed hypersensitivity immune response to uveal antigens. Enucleation with complete removal of the uveal pigment may be beneficial in preventing this subsequent immune response. The yearly incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia is estimated to be 0.03 cases per 100,000. The condition has been reported to occur from 9 days to 50&#160;years &#173;after corneoscleral perforation. The infrequency of sympathetic ophthalmia, coupled with improved medical therapy for uveitis, has made early enucleation strictly for prophylaxis a debatable practice. (See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> for additional information.)</p>
				<p class="body-text">Painful eyes without useful vision can be managed with enucleation or evisceration. Patients with end-&#173;stage neovascular glaucoma, chronic uveitis, or previously traumatized blind eyes can obtain dramatic relief from discomfort and improved cosmesis with &#173;either procedure. Enucleation can be performed satisfactorily &#173;under local, monitored, or general anesthesia, with 1 of the latter 2 options being typical. For debilitated patients unable to undergo surgery and rehabilitation, retrobulbar injection of ethanol or chlorpromazine may provide adequate pain relief. Serious complications associated with retrobulbar injections of ethanol include chronic orbital inflammation, fibrosis, and per&#173;sis&#173;tent or worsened pain.</p>
				<p class="body-text">For nonpainful, disfigured eyes without intact corneal sensation, it is generally advisable to consider a trial of a cosmetic scleral shell prior to removal of the eye. If tolerated, scleral shells can provide excellent cosmesis and motility.</p>

				<p class="h3">Enucleation in childhood</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enucleation in early childhood, as well as congenital anophthalmia or microphthalmia, may lead to underdevelopment of the involved bony orbit with secondary facial and eyelid asymmetry. Orbital soft-&#173;tissue volume is a critical determinant of orbital bone growth. Thus, for an anophthalmic socket in a young child, the surgeon aims to select an implant that maximally replaces the lost orbital volume but exerts minimal tension on the wound.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In young &#173;children, autogenous dermis-&#173;fat grafts can be used successfully as primary anophthalmic implants (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-2">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). &#173;These grafts have been shown to grow along with the expanding orbit. The opposite effect has been observed in adults, in whom a loss of volume generally occurs when dermis-&#173;fat grafts are used as primary anophthalmic implants.</p>

				<p class="h2">Intraoperative Complications of Enucleation and Evisceration</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Removal of the wrong eye</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Removal of the wrong eye is one of the most feared complications in ophthalmology. &#173;Doing an additional “time-&#173;out” immediately before enucleation or evisceration to reexamine the patient’s medical rec&#173;ord and the operative consent, and potentially to repeat ophthalmoscopy in the operating room, is of critical importance. Marking the skin near the eye to be enucleated or eviscerated &#173;after having the patient and &#173;family point to the involved eye gives further assurance.</p>

			<p class="h1">Orbital Implants</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An orbital implant’s function is to replace lost orbital volume, maintain the structure of the orbit, and impart motility to the overlying ocular prosthesis. Implants may be grouped according to the materials from which they are manufactured: <span class="italic">inert materials,</span> such as glass, silicone, or methylmethacrylate, and <span class="italic">biointegrated materials,</span> such as hydroxyapatite, porous polyethylene, and aluminum oxide (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-1"></span> <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-3">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). Biointegrated materials are designed to be incorporated by soft-&#173;tissue ingrowth from the socket.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Inert &#173;spherical implants provide comfort, have low extrusion rates, and are considered an appropriate and cost-&#173;effective choice in patients who &#173;don’t require implant integration. Disadvantages of nonporous implants include the possibilities of decreased motility and implant migration. Spheres of inert materials may be wrapped in sclera, polyglactin mesh, or autogenous materials (eg, fascia, dermis, or muscle) to provide a substrate for attachment of the extraocular muscles as well as to serve as further barrier for migration and extrusion. Inert implants transfer motility to the prosthesis only through passive movement of the socket. Buried motility implants with anterior surface projections push the overlying prosthesis with direct force and can improve prosthetic motility.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Porous implants allow for direct attachment of the extraocular muscles as well as potential placement of a peg to incorporate the prosthesis directly with the moving implant. Peg placement is usually carried out 6–12 months &#173;after enucleation to allow for complete vascular biointegration. Although pegged porous implants offer excellent motility, they also have a higher rate of postoperative complications, including inflammation and exposure. In fact, most porous implants are never pegged and are still able to achieve adequate motility.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;After enucleation, implants are placed &#173;either within the Tenon capsule or in the muscle cone &#173;behind the posterior Tenon capsule. <span class="xref-video">Video&#160;8-1</span> demonstrates enucleation followed by placement of an orbital implant. &#173;After evisceration, implants are placed &#173;either &#173;behind or within the sclera (see Fig&#160;8-1). Secure closure of Tenon capsule over the anterior surface of an anophthalmic implant is an impor&#173;tant barrier to potential &#173;later exposure.</p>

				<p class="body-text">A dermis-&#173;fat graft may be placed instead of an implant or to increase the surface area of the conjunctiva. As the conjunctiva reepithelializes over the dermis, it adds to the socket surface area.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Muscles sutured into the normal anatomical locations, &#173;either directly to the implant or to wrapping material (sclera, autogenous fascia, polyglactin mesh) surrounding the implant, allow superior motility and prevent implant migration. Extraocular muscles may migrate and slip off the anterior surface, especially if not fixated appropriately. (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-4">Fig&#160;8-4</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Following enucleation or evisceration surgery, an appropriately sized conformer is placed in the conjunctival fornices to maintain the conjunctival space that &#173;will eventually accommodate the prosthesis.</p>

				<p class="h2">Prostheses</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A custom ocular prosthesis is generally designed and placed &#173;after enucleation or evisceration. The ideal prosthesis is fitted to the exact dimensions of the patient’s conjunctival fornices &#173;after postoperative edema has subsided (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-5">Fig&#160;8-5</span>). Eviscerations may be more amenable to prosthetic fitting than enucleations. Premade or stock eyes are less satisfactory cosmetically, and they also limit prosthetic motility. In addition, they may trap secretions between the prosthesis and the socket. Typically, the patient removes the prosthesis once a month for cleaning.</p>

			<p class="h1">Anophthalmic Socket Complications and Treatment</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top5">
				<p class="h2-h1">Deep Superior Sulcus</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Deep superior sulcus deformity is caused by insufficient orbital volume. Initial management can begin with an ocularist adding volume to the ocular prosthesis. Nonsurgical treatment involves injection of hyaluronic acid filler or autologous fat transfer (
				<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-2"></span>
				<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-6">Fig&#160;8-6</span>). Surgically, this deformity can be addressed through placement of a subperiosteal implant posteriorly along the orbital floor. This subperiosteal implant advances the initial implant anteriorly and superiorly to fill the superior sulcus. Alternatively, the original implant can be replaced with a larger implant or dermis-&#173;fat graft. With any fat graft, a portion of the graft is reabsorbed over the first several months.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A related prob&#173;lem occurs when the superior conjunctival fornix is too deep. This leads to retention and buildup of mucus and debris, causing chronic discharge and infection. This condition, which is called <span class="italic">&#173;giant fornix syndrome,</span> is treated with a superior conjunctival resection, as well as topical ste&#173;roid, antibiotic, and/or povidone-&#173;iodine eyedrops when clinically indicated.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-2">Farmer&#160;LD, Rajak&#160;SN, McNab AA, Hardy&#160;TG, Selva&#160;D. Surgical correction of &#173;giant fornix syndrome. <span class="reference_italic">Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg</span>. 2016;32(2):142–144.</p>
				<p class="h2">Conjunctival Changes in the Anophthalmic Socket</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Conjunctival cyst</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival cysts form secondary to epithelial migration beneath the surface; poor wound closure during enucleation is typically the cause. &#173;These cysts may affect prosthetic function; however, treatment is typically not necessary &#173;unless the cyst size or location interferes with comfortable prosthesis wear (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-7">Fig&#160;8-7</span>).</p>
				<p class="h3">&#173;Giant papillary conjunctivitis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) commonly develops with prosthesis wear, due to the mechanical friction between the palpebral conjunctival surface and the prosthesis. Everting the upper eyelid &#173;will demonstrate the papillae (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-8">Fig&#160;8-8</span>). Patients typically pre&#173;sent with constant mucus discharge that can have a stringy consistency. Treatment consists of topical corticosteroids, topical mast cell stabilizers, and prosthetic polishing or modification, if needed.</p>
				<p class="h2">Exposure and Extrusion of the Implant</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Implants may extrude if placed too far forward, if closure of the anterior Tenon capsule is not meticulous, or if the irregular surface of the implant mechanically erodes the conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-9">Fig&#160;8-9</span>). Postoperative infection, smoking status, poor wound healing, poorly fitting prostheses or conformers, pressure points between the implant and prosthesis, and compromised vascularity may also contribute to exposure of the implant. The formation of a pyogenic granuloma, particularly if recurrent, is suggestive of implant exposure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-10">Fig&#160;8-10</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Exposed implants are subject to infection. Although small defects over porous implants may, in rare instances, close spontaneously, most exposures should be covered with scleral patch grafts or autogenous tissue grafts with a sufficient vascular bed to promote conjunctival healing. When implants are deeply seeded with infection, removal of the implant is usually required, followed by placement of an autogenous dermis-&#173;fat graft (see Fig&#160;8-2).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Dermis-&#173;fat grafts may be used when a &#173;limited amount of conjunctiva remains in the socket. This graft increases the net amount of conjunctiva available as the conjunctiva reepithelializes over the front surface of the dermis. Dermis-&#173;fat grafts may also be used in patients with a vascularized bed of tissue or vascularized implant. Unpredictable fat resorption is a drawback to the dermis-&#173;fat graft technique in adults. However, as stated &#173;earlier, dermis-&#173;fat grafts in &#173;children appear to grow along with the surrounding orbit and may help stimulate orbital development if enucleation is required during infancy or childhood.</p>
				<p class="h2">Contracture of Fornices</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preventing contracted fornices includes preserving as much conjunctiva as pos&#173;si&#173;ble and limiting dissection and cautery in the fornices. Placing extraocular muscles in their normal anatomical positions along the implant also minimizes shortening of the fornices. It is recommended that the patient wear a conformer in the immediate postoperative period to maintain soft-&#173;tissue anatomy and minimize conjunctival shortening. Conformers and prostheses should not be removed for an extended period of time. The prosthesis can be removed and cleaned, especially in the presence of infection, but should be replaced promptly &#173;after irrigation of the socket.</p>
				<p class="h2">Contracted Sockets</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Causes of contracted sockets include</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">radiation treatment (usually as treatment of a tumor that necessitated removal of the eye)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">extrusion of an orbital implant</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">severe initial injury (alkali burns or extensive lacerations)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">poor surgical techniques (excessive sacrifice or destruction of conjunctiva and Tenon capsule; traumatic dissection within the socket, causing excessive scar tissue formation)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">multiple ocular and/or socket operations</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">removal of the conformer or prosthesis for prolonged periods</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Sockets are considered contracted when the fornices are too small to retain a prosthesis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-11">Fig&#160;8-11</span>). Socket reconstruction procedures involve incision or excision of the scarred tissues and placement of a graft to enlarge the fornices. Full-&#173;thickness mucous membrane grafting is preferred &#173;because it allows the grafted tissue to match conjunctiva histologically. Amniotic membrane may be used, but is often not as robust and is more prone to cicatrization, compared to mucous membrane grafts. Buccal mucosal grafts may be taken from the cheeks (the Stensen duct, which drains the parotid gland, must be avoided), the lower or upper lip, or the hard palate (the last for rigid tissue). If the graft is taken from the lip, away from the vermilion border, patients should be advised of risk of postoperative hypesthesia. Goblet cells and mucus production are preserved.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Contracture of the fornices alone (more common with the inferior fornix) is usually associated with milder degrees of socket contracture. In &#173;these cases, a buccal mucosal graft is placed in the defect, and &#173;either a symblepharon ring or a silicone bolster with sutures to the orbital rim can be used to help maintain the fornix, depending on which fornix is involved. The ring or bolster is left in place for at least 2 weeks, &#173;after which it can be replaced with a prosthesis or conformer.</p>
				<p class="h2">Anophthalmic Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lower eyelid ectropion may result from the loosening of lower eyelid support &#173;under the weight of the prosthesis. Frequent removal of the prosthesis or use of a larger, heavier prosthesis accelerates the development of eyelid laxity (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-12">Fig&#160;8-12</span>). Tightening the eyelid via lateral tarsal strip or canthoplasty may correct the ectropion. If needed, ectropion repair can be combined with deepening of the inferior fornix by recessing the inferior retractor muscle and grafting mucous membrane tissue.</p>
				<p class="h2">Anophthalmic Ptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ptosis in anophthalmic socket syndrome typically results from inadequate volume and, less frequently, from migration of sphere implants, cicatricial tissue in the upper fornix, or damage to the levator muscle or nerve (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-13">Fig&#160;8-13</span>). Small amounts of ptosis may be managed by prosthesis modification. Greater amounts require advancement of the levator aponeurosis. This procedure is best done &#173;under local anesthesia with intraoperative adjustment of eyelid height and contour &#173;because mechanical forces may cause the surgeon to underestimate true levator function. Ptosis surgery usually improves a deep sulcus by bringing the preaponeurotic fat forward. Mild ptosis may be corrected with M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle–&#173;conjunctival resection; however, this may shorten the superior fornix. Frontalis slings are often unsuccessful due to lack of visual drive to stimulate frontalis activation to elevate the eyelid.</p>
				<p class="h2">Eyelash Margin Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelash margin entropion, trichiasis, and ptosis of the eyelashes (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-14">Fig&#160;8-14</span>) are common in patients with anophthalmic sockets. Contracture of fornices or cicatricial tissue near the eyelash margin contributes to &#173;these abnormalities. Entropion can be corrected via horizontal tarsotomy and marginal rotation surgery. Eyelash margin entropion can be corrected by splitting the eyelid margin at the gray line and grafting mucous membrane to the eyelid margin.</p>
				<p class="h2">Cosmetic Optics</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polycarbonate spectacles with par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar frame styles and tinted lenses can be used to help camouflage residual defects in the anophthalmic socket while also protecting the contralateral eye. A plus (convex) lens or minus (concave) lens may be placed in the spectacle frame in front of the prosthesis to alter the apparent size of the prosthesis. Prisms in the glasses may be used to change the apparent position of the prosthesis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Exenteration</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top6">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In exenteration, the globe and some or all of the soft tissues of the orbit are removed.</p>
				<p class="h2">Considerations for Exenteration</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exenteration should be considered in the following circumstances:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Destructive tumors extending into the orbit from the sinuses, face, eyelids, conjunctiva, or intracranial space</span>. However, exenteration is not indicated for all such tumors, especially if clear margins cannot be obtained. In such cases, immunotherapies or radiation therapy may be alternative treatments.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Intraocular melanomas or retinoblastomas that have extended outside the globe (if evidence of distant metastases is excluded).</span> When local control of the tumor would assist in the palliative care of the patient, exenteration is indicated.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Malignant epithelial tumors of the lacrimal gland.</span> Exenteration can be considered in combination with intra-&#173;arterial carotid chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, and/or adjuvant radiation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Fungal infection.</span> Subtotal or total exenteration (discussed in the next section) can be considered for the management of orbital mucormycosis. However, modern anti&#173;fungal therapies are often quite effective and most studies show no significant mortality benefit associated with exenteration in this context.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Primary orbital malignancies that do not respond to nonsurgical therapy.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-2">Hirabayashi&#160;K, Idowu&#160;OO, Kalin-&#173;Hajdu&#160;E, et&#160;al. Invasive fungal sinusitis: risk &#173;factors for visual acuity outcomes and mortality. <span class="reference_italic">Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg</span>. 2019;35(6):535–542.</p>
				<p class="h2">Types of Exenteration</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exenterations can be categorized according to the amount of tissue that is removed. Following are the types of exenteration:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Subtotal.</span> The eye and adjacent intraorbital tissues are removed so that the lesion is locally excised (leaving part of the periorbita and eyelids). This technique is used for some locally invasive tumors, for debulking of disseminated tumors, and for partial treatment in selected patients.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Total.</span> All intraorbital soft tissues, including the periorbita, are removed, with or without the skin of the eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-15">Fig&#160;8-15A</span>).</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Extended.</span> All intraorbital soft tissues are removed, together with adjacent structures (usually bony walls and sinuses).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The technique selected depends on the pathologic pro&#173;cess. The goal is to remove all lesions along with appropriate margins of adjacent tissue while retaining as much healthy tissue as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. <span class="xref-video">Video&#160;8-2</span> demonstrates orbital exenteration. Following removal of the orbital contents, the bony socket may be allowed to spontaneously granulate and epithelialize, or it may be covered by a split-&#173;thickness skin graft (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-15">Fig&#160;8-15B</span>), collagen skin replacement, or regenerative tissue matrix. The graft or skin replacement may be placed onto bare bone or over a temporalis muscle or temporoparietal fascial flap. Rehabilitation &#173;after exenteration may include a prosthesis attached to an eyeglasses frame, to the periorbital area (with adhesive), or to an osseointegrated implant, which may be facilitated with magnetic posts (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-16">Fig&#160;8-16</span>). The orbital prosthesis restores the appearance of the tissues that have been removed, including eyelids and eye, but it does not blink or move.</p>
