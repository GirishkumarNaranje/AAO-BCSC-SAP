A detailed ocular examination, including visual acuity, pupillary examination, ocular and facial motility, slit-&#173;lamp examination, and testing of tearing and protective mechanisms should be performed. Accurate documentation of &#173;these findings with photo&#173;graphs is essential, and visual field testing is obtained as appropriate.

			<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ectropion (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-1">Fig&#160;12-1</span>) is an outward turning of the eyelid margin and may be classified as the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">congenital</li>

					<li class="bullet-list-mid">cicatricial</li>

					<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">mechanical</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases seen in a general ophthalmology practice are involutional, with horizontal eyelid laxity being the primary cause. Horizontal lower eyelid tightening is the common component in surgical repair of the vari&#173;ous types of ectropion (see the section “Horizontal eyelid tightening”). Congenital ectropion of the eyelid is rare and is discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span> of this volume and in BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;6</span>, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Involutional Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Involutional ectropion results from horizontal eyelid laxity of the medial or lateral canthal tendons or both. Untreated, this condition leads to loss of eyelid apposition to the globe and eversion of the eyelid margin. Chronic conjunctival inflammation with hypertrophy and keratinization results from mechanical irritation and drying of the conjunctival surface. Involutional ectropion usually occurs in the lower eyelid &#173;because of the effects of gravity on a horizontally lax lower eyelid.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Horizontal eyelid tightening</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lower eyelid can be tightened by a variety of surgical procedures. Horizontal laxity can be detected by the <span class="italic">snapback test</span> or the <span class="italic">distraction test.</span> Lateral stretching of the eyelid at the time of the preoperative evaluation helps the surgeon assess &#173;whether lateral canthal resuspension would return the eyelid to its normal anatomic position (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-2">Fig&#160;12-2A</span>). In the <span class="italic">lateral tarsal strip procedure,</span> the tarsus is sutured directly to the lateral orbital rim periosteum (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-2B</span>). The goal of this procedure is to correct the position of the eyelid while maintaining the horizontal dimension of the palpebral fissure and a sharp, correctly positioned lateral canthal &#173;angle (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-1</span>).</p>

				<p class="body-text">Laxity of the lower limb of the medial canthal tendon can be diagnosed by demonstration of excessive lateral movement of the lower punctum with lateral eyelid traction. Repair of medial canthal laxity is more challenging than repair of horizontal lower eyelid laxity, as the anterior and posterior limbs of the medial canthal tendon surround the lacrimal sac. The repair may be complicated by a kinking of the canaliculus or distraction of the punctum away from the globe, with resultant epiphora.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Medial spindle procedure</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases of mild medial ectropion with punctal eversion, a <span class="italic">medial spindle procedure</span> can be performed. The procedure involves a horizontal fusiform excision of conjunctiva and eyelid retractors 4&#160;mm inferior to the punctum, followed by placement of inverting sutures for closure (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-2C</span>). In cases with associated horizontal eyelid laxity, lateral canthal tightening (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-2B</span>) may be used in conjunction with this procedure.</p>
				<p class="h3">Repair of lower eyelid retractors</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retractor laxity, disinsertion, or dehiscence may be associated with ectropion, especially when the eyelid is completely everted, a condition known as <span class="italic">tarsal ectropion.</span> Attenuation or disinsertion of the inferior retractors may occur as an isolated defect or may accompany horizontal laxity in involutional ectropion. When both defects are pre&#173;sent, retractor reinsertion is combined with horizontal tightening of the eyelid.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Paralytic Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See the section&#160;Facial Paralysis in this chapter.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Cicatricial Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cicatricial ectropion of the upper or lower eyelid occurs when &#173;there is a deficiency of skin secondary to thermal or chemical burns, mechanical trauma, surgical trauma, or chronic actinic skin damage. Cicatricial ectropion can also be caused by chronic inflammation of the eyelid from dermatologic conditions such as rosacea, atopic dermatitis, or eczematoid dermatitis, or by scarring from herpes zoster infections. Furthermore, chronic blepharitis caused by progressive laxity can lead to cicatricial ectropion. Management consists of addressing the under&#173;lying cause, along with meticulous corneal lubrication. Cicatricial ectropion of the lower eyelid is usually treated in a 3-&#173;step procedure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-3">Fig&#160;12-3</span>):</p>
				<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Vertical cicatricial traction is surgically released through an anterior approach.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;The eyelid is horizontally tightened.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list-last">3.&#9;The anterior lamella is vertically augmented by means of a midface-&#173;lift, full-&#173;thickness skin graft, and/or adjacent tissue transfer, and the eyelid is temporarily placed on superior traction with a suture postoperatively.</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of cicatricial ectropion or retraction of the upper eyelid usually requires only release of traction and augmentation of the vertically shortened anterior lamella with a full-&#173;thickness skin graft.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Although upper eyelid skin from the contralateral eye would be ideal for grafting, &#173;there is rarely enough tissue available from this source. The postauricular, preauricular, supraclavicular, and medial upper arm areas are other potential donor sites (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>, Fig&#160;11-7).</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Mechanical Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mechanical ectropion is usually caused by the gravitational effect of a bulky eyelid mass. Other &#173;causes include fluid accumulation, herniated orbital fat, or poorly fitted spectacles. Treatment is focused on addressing the under&#173;lying etiology.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Entropion</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Entropion is an inversion of the eyelid margin. Lower eyelid entropion (usually involutional) is much more common than upper eyelid entropion (usually cicatricial). Entropion may be unilateral or bilateral and is often classified as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">congenital</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">involutional</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">acute spastic</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">cicatricial</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital entropion is discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>.</p>
				<p class="h2">Involutional Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Involutional entropion most commonly occurs in the lower eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-4">Fig&#160;12-4</span>). Causative &#173;factors include horizontal laxity of the eyelid, attenuation or disinsertion of eyelid retractors, and overriding by the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle. Horizontal laxity can be assessed with snapback and distraction testing. Such laxity is a result of senescence, which includes stretching of the eyelids and canthal tendons. Typically, the lower eyelid retractors maintain the eyelid margin in proper orientation. However, attenuation of the eyelid retractors (capsulopalpebral fascia and inferior tarsal muscle), in conjunction with preseptal orbicularis override, allows the inferior border of the tarsus to roll forward and superiorly, resulting in inward rotation of the margin. Several clinical clues may suggest disinsertion of the retractors:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">a white subconjunctival line several millimeters below the inferior tarsal border, caused by the leading edge of the detached retractors</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">a deeper-&#173;than-&#173;normal inferior fornix</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">elevation of the lower eyelid</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">minimal movement of the lower eyelid on downgaze</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;After the entropic eyelid has been placed in its normal position, the clinician can detect superior override of the preseptal orbicularis by instructing the patient to forcefully close the eyelids. This maneuver accentuates the inward rotation of the lower eyelid margin. Procedures to repair involutional entropion of the lower eyelid fall into 3 groups: temporizing mea&#173;sures, horizontal tightening procedures, and retractor repair. Often, a combination of procedures is necessary. If trichiasis is pre&#173;sent, it may require specific treatment, &#173;either in conjunction with the entropion repair or subsequently, if the eyelashes remain misdirected &#173;after proper positioning of the eyelid margin (see the Trichiasis section in this chapter).</p>
				<p class="h3">Temporizing mea&#173;sures</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lubrication and a ban&#173;dage contact lens may be used to protect the cornea from mechanical abrasion by the misdirected eyelashes. Rotational suture techniques (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-5">Fig&#160;12-5</span>) are occasionally helpful as temporizing mea&#173;sures in involutional entropion; however, when &#173;these techniques are used in isolation, recurrence is anticipated.</p>
				<p class="h3">Surgical repair</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Direct repair of lower eyelid retractor defects through a skin incision (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-6">Fig&#160;12-6A</span>) or a transconjunctival approach (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-6B</span>) can be performed to stabilize the inferior border of the tarsus. In addition, a small amount of preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle can be removed in selected patients in whom it overrides the pretarsal orbicularis. Reinsertion of the eyelid retractors and &#173;limited myectomy of the orbicularis oculi in conjunction with a lower eyelid tightening procedure, such as a lateral tarsal strip operation or wedge resection (see

				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Acute Spastic Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute spastic entropion arises from ocular irritation or inflammation. Sustained contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle leads to inward rotation of the eyelid margin. A cycle of increasing frequency of orbicularis muscle spasm caused by corneal irritation perpetuates the prob&#173;lem. The acute entropion usually resolves when the cycle is broken by treatment of the under&#173;lying cause.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Taping of the entropic eyelid to evert the margin or use of cautery or vari&#173;ous rotational suture techniques (see <span class="xref-figure-local" id="Fig 12-5">Fig&#160;12-5</span>) afford temporary relief for most patients. In selected cases, botulinum toxin injection can be used to temporarily paralyze the overriding preseptal orbicularis muscle. However, involutional changes are often pre&#173;sent in the eyelid; therefore, definitive surgical repair may be required.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Cicatricial Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cicatricial entropion is caused by vertical tarsoconjunctival contracture and internal rotation of the eyelid margin, with resulting irritation of the globe from inturned cilia or the keratinized eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-7">Fig&#160;12-7</span>). Vari&#173;ous conditions may lead to cicatricial entropion, including <span class="italic">autoimmune</span> (mucous membrane [ocular cicatricial] pemphigoid), <span class="italic">inflammatory</span> (Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-8">Fig&#160;12-8</span>), <span class="italic">infectious</span> (trachoma, herpes zoster), <span class="italic">surgical</span> (enucleation, posterior-&#173;approach ptosis correction, transconjunctival surgery), and <span class="italic">traumatic</span> (thermal or chemical burns, scarring) conditions. The long-&#173;term use of topical glaucoma medi&#173;cations, especially miotics and prostaglandin analogs, may cause chronic conjunctivitis with vertical conjunctival shortening and secondary cicatricial entropion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The patient’s history, along with a &#173;simple diagnostic test <span class="italic">(digital eversion),</span> usually distinguishes cicatricial entropion from involutional entropion. Attempting to return the eyelid to a normal anatomic position using digital traction &#173;will correct the abnormal margin position in involutional entropion but not in cicatricial entropion. In addition, inspection of the posterior lamella may reveal scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva in cases of cicatricial entropion.</p>
				<p class="h3">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Successful management of cicatricial entropion depends on careful preoperative evaluation to determine the cause, severity, and prominent features of the condition in each patient. When the etiology is autoimmune or inflammatory disease, the prognosis is guarded &#173;because of frequent disease progression.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Cicatricial entropion usually requires surgery, but lubricating eyedrops and ointments, barriers to symblepharon formation, and eyelash ablation with eyelash cautery are sometimes useful. Indeed, surgery is contraindicated, particularly on the conjunctival surface, during the acute phase of autoimmune diseases, and medical management of the inflammatory condition with topical and systemic medi&#173;cations is more appropriate &#173;until the disease stabilizes. When surgery is indicated, maximal inflammatory suppression is achieved with pulsed systemic anti-&#173;inflammatory medi&#173;cations (corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents).</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Tarsotomy (tarsal fracture)</span> is useful in cases of mild to moderate cicatricial entropion <span class="italic">(marginal entropion)</span> of the upper or lower eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-9">Fig&#160;12-9</span>). In this situation, eyelashes abrade the cornea, and careful examination shows that the eyelid margin has lost its square edges and is rotated posteriorly. A posterior horizontal tarsal incision is made 2&#160;mm distal to the eyelid margin; this incision through the full thickness of the tarsus allows the eyelid margin to be rotated away from the globe. The eyelid position is stabilized with everting sutures.</p>
				<p class="body-text">For margin rotation to be effective, the tarsus should be intact and of reasonably good quality. In patients with severe cicatricial entropion, the involved tarsus is usually scarred and distorted and needs to be replaced. In the upper eyelid, tarsoconjunctival and other mucosal grafts are useful tarsal substitutes; in the lower eyelid, autogenous ear cartilage, preserved scleral grafts, hard-&#173;palate mucosa, and acellular dermal matrix (&#173;human and porcine) grafts have been used.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Symblepharon</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Symblepharon is an adhesion between conjunctival surfaces. It can occur as a result of inflammation, infection, trauma, or previous surgery. Conjunctival Z-&#173;plasties are sometimes effective for localized contracted linear adhesions when vertical lengthening of the involved tissue is the primary objective. More extensive symblepharon formation requires a full-&#173;thickness conjunctival graft or flap, a partial-&#173;thickness mucous membrane graft, or an amniotic membrane graft.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Trichiasis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top6">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trichiasis is an acquired misdirection of eyelashes (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-10">Fig&#160;12-10</span>). The treatment method is usually determined by the pattern (segmental or diffuse) of the misdirected eyelashes and the quality of the posterior lamella of the involved eyelid. Inturned eyelashes not associated with involutional entropion are usually seen in cases of chronic eyelid inflammation and posterior lamellar scarring <span class="italic">(marginal cicatricial entropion).</span> If the eyelid margin is misdirected, treatment should focus on correcting the entropion.</p>
				<p class="h2">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trichiasis may be initially treated with <span class="italic">mechanical epilation.</span> &#173;Because of eyelash regrowth, recurrence can be expected 3–8 weeks &#173;after epilation. Broken cilia are often more irritating to the cornea than longer, mature eyelashes. The following treatments have been associated with longer therapeutic win&#173;dows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Electrolysis</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">radiofrequency ablation</span>. Energy is delivered through an insulated needle to destroy the hair follicle. When the needle tip is removed, the eyelash is easily extracted. Recurrence rate is high, adjacent normal eyelashes may be damaged, and scarring of the adjacent eyelid margin tissue can worsen the prob&#173;lem.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Cryotherapy</span>. The involved area is frozen for approximately 25 seconds, allowed to thaw, and then refrozen for 20 seconds <span class="bullet-list_italic">(double freeze–&#173;thaw technique).</span> The eyelashes are mechanically removed with forceps &#173;after treatment. Edema lasting several days, loss of skin pigmentation, notching of the eyelid margin, and pos&#173;si&#173;ble interference with goblet cell function are disadvantages of cryotherapy.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Argon &#173;laser therapy.</span> &#173;Laser energy is delivered to the follicle; some pigment is required in the base of the lash to absorb the &#173;laser energy and ablate the lash, making this technique sensitive to hair color.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">In all of &#173;these procedures, success rates vary, and additional treatment sessions are commonly necessary. An ophthalmic microtrephine can also be used to extract individual misdirected eyelashes. <span class="italic">Full-&#173;thickness pentagonal resection</span> with primary closure may be considered when trichiasis is confined to a &#173;limited segment of the eyelid.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Blepharoptosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top7">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blepharoptosis, also referred to as <span class="italic">ptosis,</span> is the inferior displacement of the upper eyelid. It is a common cause of reversible peripheral vision loss. Although the superior visual field is most often involved, central vision can also be affected. Many patients with ptosis report difficulty with reading &#173;because the ptosis worsens in downgaze. Ptosis has also been shown to decrease the overall amount of light that reaches the macula and, therefore, can reduce visual acuity, especially at night.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Upper eyelid ptosis can be classified by onset as <span class="italic">congenital</span> or <span class="italic">acquired.</span> It can be further categorized by the cause: <span class="italic">myogenic, aponeurotic, neurogenic, mechanical,</span> or <span class="italic">traumatic.</span> The most common type of congenital ptosis is myogenic and results from a poorly developed levator palpebrae superioris muscle; the most common type of acquired ptosis is aponeurotic and is caused by stretching or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis<span class="italic">.</span></p>
				<p class="h2">Evaluation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many ele&#173;ments are involved in the evaluation of blepharoptosis. The history can provide pertinent clues, such as variability in the degree of ptosis, which suggests myasthenia gravis. Historical data can also be assessed by examining old photos or a driver license photo&#173;graph. Affected &#173;family members may highlight potential heritable conditions such as oculopharyngeal or myotonic dystrophy. The physical examination further elucidates etiology through eyelid mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, assessment of surrounding orbital and facial structures, and observation of head positioning and pos&#173;si&#173;ble synkinetic movements. The pupils and tear film are also assessed. Further ancillary testing may be guided by additional history and clinical examination findings.</p>

				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">margin–&#173;reflex distance 1 (MRD</span><span class="italic_subscript CharOverride-1">1</span><span class="italic">),</span> which is the distance from the upper eyelid margin to the corneal light reflex in primary position, is the single most impor&#173;tant mea&#173;sure&#173;ment in describing the amount of ptosis. In severe ptosis, the light reflex may be obstructed by the eyelid, and the MRD<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> has a zero or negative value. The more ptotic eyelid should be elevated to unmask occult contralateral ptosis, according to Hering’s law of equal innervation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-12">Fig&#160;12-12</span>). If the patient reports visual obstruction while reading, the eyelid position in downgaze is checked. Lower eyelid retraction (or scleral show) should be noted separately as the <span class="italic">margin</span>–&#173;<span class="italic">reflex distance 2 (MRD</span><span class="italic_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="italic">).</span> The&#160;MRD<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> is the distance from the corneal light reflex to the lower eyelid margin. The sum of the MRD<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> and the MRD<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> should equal the vertical palpebral fissure/palpebral fissure height.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">vertical palpebral fissure</span> is mea&#173;sured at the widest point between the lower eyelid and the upper eyelid. This mea&#173;sure&#173;ment is taken with the patient fixating on a distant object in primary gaze.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The distance from the <span class="italic">upper eyelid crease</span> to the eyelid margin is also mea&#173;sured. The insertion of fibers from the levator muscle into the skin contributes to formation of the upper eyelid crease; therefore, the crease is often elevated in patients with involutional ptosis and is often shallow or absent in patients with congenital ptosis. &#173;There is ethnic variation in baseline eyelid crease height, with the upper eyelid crease being typically lower or obscured in the Asian eyelid compared to the non-&#173;Asian eyelid.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Levator function</span> is estimated by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the <span class="italic">upper eyelid excursion</span> from downgaze to upgaze. Fixating the brow with digital pressure minimizes contributions from accessory elevators of the eyelids, such as the frontalis muscle. Failure to negate the influence of the frontalis muscle results in overestimation of levator function, which may affect the diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, the patient should be assessed for <span class="italic">lagophthalmos;</span> if it is pre&#173;sent, mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the gap between the eyelids should be noted (in millimeters). Lagophthalmos, poor orbicularis strength, and poor tear film quantity or quality may predispose the patient to complications of ptosis repair such as dryness and exposure keratopathy.</p>
				<p class="h3">Additional assessments</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Physical examination also includes checking <span class="italic">head position, chin elevation, brow position,</span> and <span class="italic">brow action</span> in attempted upgaze. &#173;These features help to show the patient how ptosis affects function. Quantity and quality of the tear film is documented in the initial examination. The examiner should also note the presence or absence of supraduction of the globe with eyelid closure <span class="italic">(Bell phenomenon)</span> and assess corneal sensation; &#173;these &#173;factors may affect the treatment plan.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Variation in the amount of ptosis with extraocular muscle or jaw muscle movements <span class="italic">(synkinesis)</span> occurs in several conditions, including Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking ptosis, aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve or the facial nerve, and some types of Duane retraction syndrome. The examiner should attempt to elicit synkinesis as part of the evaluation of patients with congenital blepharoptosis or &#173;those with pos&#173;si&#173;ble aberrant regeneration.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">position of the ptotic eyelid in downgaze</span> (palpebral fissure in downgaze) can help differentiate between congenital and acquired &#173;causes. The congenitally ptotic eyelid is typically higher in downgaze than the contralateral eyelid. The congenitally ptotic eyelid may also manifest lagophthalmos. By contrast, in acquired involutional ptosis, the affected eyelid remains ptotic in all positions of gaze and may even worsen in downgaze with relaxation of the frontalis muscle.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist must assess <span class="italic">visual function</span> and <span class="italic">refractive error</span> in all cases of congenital or childhood ptosis in order to identify and treat the child with concomitant amblyopia that results from anisometropia, high astigmatism, strabismus, or occlusion of the pupil. Amblyopia occurs in approximately 20% of patients with congenital ptosis, thus, concomitant evaluation by a pediatric ophthalmologist may be necessary. <span class="italic">Extraocular muscle function</span> should also be assessed to identify potential congenital (combined superior rectus/levator muscle maldevelopment, congenital oculomotor palsy) and acquired (ocular or systemic myasthenia gravis, mitochondrial myopathy, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, oculomotor palsy with or without aberrant regeneration) conditions.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In addition, <span class="italic">pupillary examination</span> is impor&#173;tant in the evaluation of ptosis. Pupil abnormalities are pre&#173;sent in some acquired and congenital conditions associated with ptosis (eg, Horner syndrome, cranial nerve III palsy). Miosis that is most apparent in dim illumination is a finding in Horner syndrome; mydriasis is seen in some cases of oculomotor nerve palsy.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">External examination</span> may reveal other abnormalities as well. For example, severe bilateral congenital ptosis may be associated with telecanthus, epicanthus inversus, hypoplasia of the superior orbital rims, horizontal shortening of the eyelids, ear deformities, hypertelorism, and hypoplasia of the nasal bridge. &#173;These findings are classically seen in <span class="italic">blepharophimosis–&#173;ptosis–&#173;epicanthus inversus syndrome</span> (<span class="italic">BPES;</span> discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>).</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Ancillary testing</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Visual field testing</span> may be used to quantitate the patient’s level of functional visual impairment. Comparison of visual fields with the eyelids elevated with tape to &#173;those with the eyelids in their natu&#173;ral ptotic state gives an estimate of the superior visual field improvement that can be anticipated following surgery. Visual field testing and external full-&#173;face photography may be required by third-&#173;party payers for insurance coverage.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pharmacologic testing, pupillary evaluation in light and dark,</span> and <span class="italic">lower eyelid elevation (smaller MRD</span><span class="italic_subscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="italic">)</span> may be helpful in confirming the clinical diagnosis of <span class="italic">Horner syndrome</span> and in localizing the causative lesion (see BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;5</span>, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). Third-&#173;order neuron dysfunction resulting in Horner syndrome is typically benign. However, neuron dysfunction of the first or second order is sometimes associated with malignant neoplasms such as an apical lung (Pancoast) tumor, aneurysm, or dissection of the carotid artery.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic testing may also be used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG), a disease in which ptosis is the most common presenting sign. Fluctuating ptosis that seems to worsen with fatigue or prolonged upgaze—&#173;especially when accompanied by diplopia or other clinical signs of systemic MG such as dysphonia, dyspnea, dysphagia, or proximal muscle weakness—is an indication for further diagnostic evaluation with the edrophonium chloride, ice-&#173;pack, or acetylcholine receptor antibody tests. (Also see the section “Myasthenia gravis” in this chapter.)</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Classification</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Myogenic ptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The patient’s history usually distinguishes congenital from acquired ptosis. <span class="italic">Congenital myogenic ptosis</span> results from dysgenesis of the levator muscle. Instead of normal muscle fibers, fibrous or adipose tissue is pre&#173;sent in the muscle belly, diminishing the ability of the levator to contract and relax. Therefore, most congenital ptosis caused by maldevelopment of the levator muscle is characterized by decreased levator function, lid lag, and, sometimes, lagophthalmos (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-13">Fig&#160;12-13</span>). The upper eyelid crease is often absent or poorly formed, especially in patients with more severe ptosis. Congenital myogenic ptosis associated with a poor palpebral oculogyric reflex (Bell phenomenon) or with vertical strabismus may indicate concomitant maldevelopment of the superior rectus and levator muscles (<span class="italic">monocular elevation deficiency,</span> formerly called <span class="italic">double-&#173;elevator palsy</span>)<span class="italic">.</span></p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Acquired myogenic ptosis</span> results from localized or diffuse muscular disease such as muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathy (ie, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), MG, or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-14">Fig&#160;12-14A</span>). &#173;Because of the under&#173;lying muscle dysfunction, surgical correction may require a frontalis suspension or advancement procedure (Fig&#160;12-14B).</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Aponeurotic ptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The levator aponeurosis transmits levator palpebrae superioris muscle force to the eyelid. Thus, any disruption in its anatomy or function can lead to ptosis.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Acquired aponeurotic ptosis</span> is the most common form of ptosis. It results from stretching or dehiscence of the levator aponeurosis or disinsertion from its normal position. Common &#173;causes are involutional attenuation or repetitive traction on the eyelid, which may occur with frequent eye rubbing or prolonged use of contact lenses. Aponeurotic ptosis may also be caused or exacerbated by intraocular surgery or eyelid surgery (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-15">Fig&#160;12-15</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Eyelids with aponeurotic defects characteristically have a high or an absent upper eyelid crease secondary to upward displacement or loss of the insertion of levator fibers into the skin. Thinning of the eyelid superior to the upper tarsal plate is often an associated finding. &#173;Because the levator muscle itself is healthy, levator function in aponeurotic ptosis is usually normal (15&#160;mm). Acquired aponeurotic ptosis may worsen in downgaze, thus interfering with the patient’s ability to read, as well as limiting the superior visual field. <span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-1">&#173;Table&#160;12-1</span> compares acquired aponeurotic ptosis with congenital myogenic ptosis.</p>
				<p class="h3">Neurogenic ptosis</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Congenital conditions</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Congenital neurogenic ptosis</span> is caused by innervational defects that occur during embryonic development. This condition is relatively rare and is most commonly associated with congenital cranial nerve III (CN III) palsy, congenital Horner syndrome, and Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking syndrome.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Congenital oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy</span> is manifested as ptosis together with the inability to elevate, depress, or adduct the globe. The pupils may also be dilated. This palsy may be partial or complete, but ptosis is very rarely an isolated finding. It is uncommon to find aberrant innervation in congenital CN III palsies. Management of strabismus and amblyopia is difficult in many cases of congenital CN III palsy. Treatment of the associated ptosis is also complicated, usually requiring a frontalis suspension procedure, which often leads to some degree of lagophthalmos. As a result of poor ocular motility, lagophthalmos, and poor postoperative eyelid excursion, postoperative management may be complicated by diplopia, exposure keratopathy, and corneal ulceration.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Congenital Horner syndrome</span> is a manifestation of an interruption in the sympathetic nerve chain. It can cause mild ptosis associated with miosis, anhidrosis, and decreased pigmentation of the iris on the involved side. The mild ptosis of Horner syndrome results from an innervational deficit to the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle. Decreased sympathetic tone to the inferior tarsal muscle in the lower eyelid results in elevation of the lower eyelid, sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">reverse ptosis.</span> The combination of upper ptosis and lower eyelid elevation decreases the vertical palpebral fissure and may falsely suggest enophthalmos. Associated pupillary miosis is most apparent in dim illumination, when the contralateral pupil dilates more.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Congenital neurogenic ptosis may also be synkinetic. <span class="italic">Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking syndrome</span> is the most common form of congenital synkinetic neurogenic ptosis (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-4</span>, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-16">Fig&#160;12-16</span>). In this synkinetic syndrome, the unilaterally ptotic eyelid elevates with jaw movements. The movement that most commonly &#173;causes elevation of the ptotic eyelid is lateral mandibular movement to the contralateral side. This phenomenon is usually first noticed by the &#173;mother when she is feeding or nursing the baby. This synkinesis is thought to be caused by aberrant connections between the motor division of CN V and the levator muscle. Infrequently, this syndrome is associated with abnormal connections between CN III and other cranial nerves. Some forms of Duane retraction syndrome also cause elevation of a ptotic eyelid with movement of the globe. This congenital syndrome is also thought to result from aberrant nerve connections.</p>

				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Acquired conditions</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Acquired neurogenic ptosis</span> results from interruption of normal development of innervation and is most often secondary to an acquired CN III palsy or Horner syndrome.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Delineation of the cause of acquired CN III (oculomotor) palsy is impor&#173;tant. Distinction must be made between <span class="italic">ischemic</span> and <span class="italic">compressive</span> etiologies. Most acquired CN III palsies are <span class="italic">ischemic</span> and associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or arteriosclerotic disease. Typically, <span class="italic">ischemic</span> acquired CN III palsies do not include pupillary abnormalities, may be associated with pain, and resolve spontaneously with satisfactory levator function within 3 months. If a pupil-&#173;sparing CN III palsy fails to resolve spontaneously within 3–6 months, further workup for a compressive lesion is indicated. However, if a patient pre&#173;sents with a CN III palsy involving the pupil, an immediate workup (including neuroimaging) should commence in order to rule out a compressive neoplastic or aneurysmal lesion. Surgical correction of ptosis related to CN III palsy usually requires frontalis suspension and should be reserved for patients in whom strabismus surgery allows single binocular vision in a useful field of gaze. See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;5</span>, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Temporary neurogenic ptosis</span> can be caused by inadvertent diffusion of botulinum toxin into the levator muscle complex following therapeutic injection in the forehead or orbital region. The resultant ptosis usually resolves &#173;after several weeks.</p>
				<p class="h3">Neuromuscular ptosis</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Myasthenia gravis (MG)</span> MG is an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies bind the acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction. Over 75% of patients &#173;will initially pre&#173;sent with <span class="h4-text_italic">ocular myasthenia gravis</span> (ie, effects isolated to the periocular musculature), with ptosis and diplopia being the most common presenting signs. Marked variability in the degree of ptosis experienced during the day and reports of diplopia should suggest ocular MG. Examination may reveal poor orbicularis strength, enhancement of ptosis (Hering’s law of equal innervation), and variable sensorimotor examination (see Fig&#160;12-12). Over 50% of patients with ocular MG &#173;will secondarily generalize within several years, which heightens the importance of patient counseling regarding potential risks for morbidity, including difficulty breathing. Approximately 10% of patients with generalized MG have an associated thymoma; thus, chest computed tomography (CT) should be considered for all patients with MG to rule out this lesion. Surgical thymectomy results in clinical improvement in 75% of cases of generalized MG and complete remission in 35% of cases. Other auto&#173;&#173;immune disorders, such as thyroid eye disease (TED), may occur concomitantly in patients with myasthenia.</p>
				<p class="body-text">No single test for MG &#173;will detect all cases. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmologic consultation is useful in the evaluation and treatment of MG. Surgical treatment of ptosis should be delayed &#173;until medical management of MG is optimized. &#173;Because of the variability of levator function, frontalis suspension may be considered. See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;5</span>, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Hendricks&#160;TM, Bhatti&#160;MT, Hodge&#160;DO, Chen&#160;JJ.&#160;Incidence, Epidemiology, and Transformation of Ocular Myasthenia Gravis: A Population-&#173;Based Study [published correction appears in <span class="reference_italic">Am J&#160;Ophthalmol</span>. 2021; 227:288].&#160;<span class="reference_italic">Am J&#160;Ophthalmol.</span> 2019;205:99–105.</p>
				<p class="h3">Mechanical ptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In mechanical ptosis, the upper eyelid is weighed down by a mass or swelling in the eyelid or orbit (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-17">Fig&#160;12-17</span>). It may be caused by a congenital mass lesion such as a plexiform neurofibroma or hemangioma, or by an acquired lesion such as a large chalazion or skin carcinoma. Postsurgical or posttraumatic edema may also cause temporary mechanical ptosis.</p>
				<p class="h3">Traumatic ptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trauma to the levator aponeurosis or the levator palpebrae superioris muscle may cause ptosis through myogenic, aponeurotic, neurogenic, or mechanical defects. An eyelid laceration that exposes preaponeurotic fat indicates that the orbital septum has been &#173;violated and suggests pos&#173;si&#173;ble damage to the levator muscle and/or aponeurosis. Exploration of the levator and its repair may be indicated in this situation. Orbital and neurosurgical procedures can also lead to traumatic ptosis. Since such ptosis may resolve or improve spontaneously, the ophthalmologist typically observes the patient for an extended period before considering surgical intervention.</p>
				<p class="h3">Pseudoptosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pseudoptosis, which gives the appearance of a drooping eyelid, should be differentiated from true ptosis. An eyelid may appear to be abnormally low in vari&#173;ous conditions, including brow ptosis, enophthalmos, &#173;silent sinus syndrome, microphthalmia, anophthalmia, phthisis bulbi, synkinesis, and superior sulcus defect secondary to trauma or other &#173;causes. Contralateral upper eyelid retraction, for instance, from TED, may also simulate ptosis. The term <span class="italic">pseudoptosis</span> is also sometimes used to describe <span class="italic">dermatochalasis,</span> the condition in which excess upper eyelid skin overhangs the eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-18">Fig&#160;12-18</span>).</p>
				<p class="h2">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ptosis repair is a challenging and often-&#173;debated topic. The patient’s ocular, medical, and surgical history help determine &#173;whether surgical repair is appropriate. Specifically, the surgeon should be aware of any history of dry eye, TED, neuromuscular disorder, previous eye or eyelid surgery or neurotoxin injections, and periorbital trauma.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Ptosis that &#173;causes amblyopia, significant superior visual field loss, or difficulty with reading is considered to be a <span class="italic">functional</span> prob&#173;lem. In other instances, ptosis may be considered a <span class="italic">cosmetic</span> issue. &#173;Because ptosis repair is often an elective surgical procedure, it is particularly impor&#173;tant for the surgeon to review the cosmetic and functional consequences of the procedure as well as potential risks.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Ptosis repair surgery should be directed &#173;toward correction of the under&#173;lying pathologic condition. The 3 categories of surgical procedures most commonly used in ptosis repair are</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">external (transcutaneous) levator advancement</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">internal (transconjunctival) levator/tarsus/M<span class="bullet-list_accent">ü</span>ller muscle resection</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">frontalis muscle suspension or advancement</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The patient’s amount and type of ptosis and degree of levator function are the most common determining &#173;factors in selecting the type of corrective surgery. In patients with good levator function, surgical correction is generally directed &#173;toward the levator aponeurosis. However, if levator function is poor or absent, frontalis muscle suspension techniques are preferred.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">External (transcutaneous) levator advancement</span> surgery is most commonly used when levator function is normal and the upper eyelid crease is high (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-5</span>). In &#173;these patients, the levator muscle itself is normal, but the levator aponeurosis is stretched or disinserted, thus requiring advancement. The levator aponeurosis is approached externally through an upper eyelid crease incision and is advanced to the superior tarsal border. The patient’s cooperation is elicited to open the eyelids to obtain optimal height and contour. This surgery can also be accomplished through a small incision no longer than 1&#160;cm (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-19">Fig&#160;12-19</span>).</p>

				<p class="body-text">Many patients with significant ptosis use the frontalis muscle in an attempt to raise the eyelid and clear the visual axis. In <span class="italic">frontalis suspension</span> surgery (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-21">Fig&#160;12-21</span>), which is performed when levator function is poor or absent, the eyelid is suspended directly from the frontalis muscle so that movement of the brow is efficiently transmitted to the eyelid. Thus, the patient is able to elevate the eyelid by using the frontalis muscle to lift the brow. Several sling options exist for frontalis suspension; they can be grouped as autogenous, allogenic, or synthetic.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Autogenous tensor fascia lata</span> has shown good long-&#173;term results but requires the patient to undergo additional surgery related to tissue harvesting.

				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Allogenic slings,</span> such as banked fascia lata, can be obtained from a variety of sources and spares the patient harvesting surgery.

				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">frontalis muscle advancement flap</span> procedure, in which the muscle itself is brought inferiorly to the eyelid, can also be utilized for myogenic ptosis; this obviates the placement of an autogenous, allogenic, or synthetic sling.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;There is some controversy about &#173;whether bilateral frontalis suspension should be performed in patients with unilateral congenital ptosis. A bilateral procedure may improve the patient’s symmetry and stimulate the need to utilize the frontalis muscle to lift the eyelids, but it subjects the normal eyelid to surgical risks. The decision of &#173;whether to modify a normal eyelid in an attempt to gain symmetry should be discussed by the surgeon and the patient or the patient’s caregiver.</p>
				<p class="h3">Complications</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Undercorrection is the most common complication of ptosis repair. Astute judgment is required to differentiate this from a mechanical ptosis caused by early postoperative edema. Other potential complications include overcorrection, unsatisfactory eyelid contour, scarring, wound dehiscence, eyelid crease asymmetry, conjunctival prolapse, tarsal eversion, implant extrusion, and lagophthalmos with exposure keratopathy. This last condition is usually temporary, but it requires treatment with lubricating eyedrops or ointments &#173;until it resolves. Achieving symmetry between the 2 eyelids is a difficult aspect of ptosis repair, and some ptosis surgeons use adjustable suture techniques or early adjustment in the office during the first 2 postoperative weeks, when indicated.</p>
				<p class="h3">Nonsurgical options</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Temporary ptosis correction by approximately 1–2&#160;mm can be achieved with a prescription for a 0.1% oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution eyedrop, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Studies have shown that its effects can last 8–14 hours. Patients may experience tachyphylaxis with oxymetazoline &#173;after repetitive use.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Ptosis eyelid crutches can be utilized for severe ptosis in patients who are incapable of undergoing surgery. The crutches, which are attached to the top rim of the eyeglasses, compress the eyelid near the superior orbital rim, mechanically elevating the eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-22">Fig&#160;12-22</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Eyelid Retraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top8">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid retraction is the superior or inferior displacement of the upper or lower eyelids, respectively, that exposes sclera between the limbus and the eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-23">Fig&#160;12-23</span>). It can be unilateral or bilateral. Lower eyelid retraction may also be a normal anatomic variant in patients who have shallow orbits or certain ge&#173;ne&#173;tic orbital or eyelid characteristics. Retraction of the eyelids often leads to lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy, with consequences ranging from ocular irritation and discomfort to vision-&#173;threatening corneal exposure.</p>
				<p class="h2">&#173;Causes</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The &#173;causes of eyelid retraction may be local, systemic, or to do with the central ner&#173;vous system. The most common are TED, recession of the vertical rectus muscles, aggressive tissue removal during blepharoplasty, and overcompensation for a contralateral ptosis (Hering’s law of equal innervation).</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Thyroid eye disease</span> is the most common cause of both upper and lower eyelid retraction, as well as unilateral or bilateral proptosis. &#173;Because proptosis commonly coexists with and may mimic eyelid retraction (and vice versa) in patients with TED, &#173;these conditions are evaluated through eyelid mea&#173;sure&#173;ments and exophthalmometry. A common finding in TED-&#173;related eyelid retraction is <span class="italic">temporal flare.</span> In this condition, the eyelid retraction is more severe laterally than medially, resulting in an abnormal upper eyelid contour that appears to flare upward along the lateral half of the eyelid margin. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for a more extensive discussion of TED.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Iatrogenic</span> eyelid retraction may be induced by recession of the vertical rectus muscles, owing to anatomic connections between the superior rectus and the levator palpebrae superioris muscle in the upper eyelid and between the inferior rectus muscle and capsulopalpebral fascia in the lower eyelid. Another iatrogenic cause of eyelid retraction, especially of the lower eyelids, is excessive resection of skin, &#173;middle lamellar scarring, and untreated lower eyelid laxity during cosmetic lower blepharoplasty. Correction may require any combination of lower eyelid tightening, midface-&#173;lifting, full-&#173;thickness skin grafting, or spacer grafting. Conservative excision of skin in lower blepharoplasty, along with concomitant correction of any lower eyelid laxity, minimizes the risk of this prob&#173;lem.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Other etiologies include <span class="italic">Parinaud syndrome,</span> an example of eyelid retraction caused by a lesion that affects the dorsal midbrain. <span class="italic">Congenital</span> eyelid retraction occurs as a rare, isolated entity.</p>
				<p class="h2">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of eyelid retraction is based on its severity as well as under&#173;lying etiologic &#173;factors. In patients with mild eyelid retraction, artificial tears, lubricants, and ointments may be sufficient to protect the cornea and minimize symptoms. The use of moisture chamber goggles and PROSE (Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem) lenses may also be indicated. Mild eyelid retraction resulting from lower blepharoplasty or TED may resolve spontaneously over time. A variety of surgical techniques have been developed to correct eyelid retraction that is per&#173;sis&#173;tent and/or sight threatening. Except in cases of severe exposure keratopathy, surgical intervention is undertaken only &#173;after serial mea&#173;sure&#173;ments have established stability of the eyelid position. Upper eyelid retraction can be corrected by excision or recession of the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle (anterior or posterior approach), recession of the levator aponeurosis with or without hang-&#173;back sutures or another spacer (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-24">Fig&#160;12-24&#160;A, B</span>), mea&#173;sured myotomy of the levator muscle, or full-&#173;thickness transverse blepharotomy (Fig&#160;12-24&#160;C, D).</p>
				<p class="body-text">If the patient has lateral flare, a small eyelid-&#173;splitting lateral tarsorrhaphy, combined with recession of the upper and lower eyelid retractors, can improve the upper eyelid contour; however, this technique may limit the patient’s lateral visual field.</p>
				<p class="body-text">As with correction of the upper eyelids, treatment of lower eyelid retraction is directed by the under&#173;lying etiologic &#173;factors. <span class="italic">Anterior lamellar deficiency</span> (eg, excess skin resection from blepharoplasty) requires recruitment of vertical skin by means of a midface-&#173;lift and/or addition of skin with a full-&#173;thickness skin graft. <span class="italic">&#173;Middle lamellar deficiency</span> (eg, posttraumatic septal scarring) requires scar release and pos&#173;si&#173;ble placement of a spacer graft. <span class="italic">Posterior lamellar deficiency</span> from congenital scarring or conjunctival shortage (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid) may require a full-&#173;thickness mucous membrane graft.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Severe retraction of the lower eyelids, common in patients with TED, may require a spacer graft between the lower eyelid retractors and the inferior tarsal border. Autogenous auricular cartilage, hard-&#173;palate mucosa, &#173;free tarsal grafts (see Figure&#160;12-24&#160;C, D), acellular dermal matrix, and dermis fat are common spacer materials. It is often necessary to perform some type of horizontal eyelid or lateral canthal tightening or elevation as well. However, &#173;because horizontal tightening of the lower eyelid in a patient with proptosis may exacerbate the eyelid retraction, use of this technique requires caution. Many surgeons believe that significant upper and lower eyelid retraction in the setting of proptosis is optimally treated with orbital decompression prior to eyelid retraction surgery &#173;because the decrease in exophthalmos may improve the severity of eyelid retraction.</p>
				<p class="body-text">For patients who are poor surgical candidates or may require a temporizing mea&#173;sure &#173;until adequately stable for surgery, nonsurgical options include neurotoxin or ste&#173;roid injection to the upper eyelid retractors. &#173;These injections can be placed anteriorly through the skin or posteriorly through the conjunctiva.</p>

			<p class="h1">Facial Paralysis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top9">
				<p class="h2-h1">Paralytic Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Paralytic ectropion usually follows CN VII paralysis or palsy. Typically, concomitant upper eyelid lagophthalmos is pre&#173;sent secondary to paralytic orbicularis dysfunction. Poor blinking and eyelid closure lead to chronic ocular surface irritation from corneal exposure as well as inadequate tear film replenishment and distribution. Chronically stimulated reflex tear secretion, atonic eyelids, and lacrimal pump failure account for patients’ frequent reports of tearing.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Neurologic evaluation may be needed to determine the cause of CN VII paralysis. In cases resulting from stroke or intracranial surgery, clinical evaluation of corneal sensation is indicated &#173;because neurotrophic keratopathy combined with paralytic lagophthalmos increases the risk of corneal exposure and perforation.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Lubricating drops, viscous tear supplementation, ointments, taping of the temporal half of the lower eyelid, or moisture chamber goggles can be used. Such mea&#173;sures may be the only treatment necessary, especially for temporary paralysis. In select patients with long-&#173;term or permanent paralysis, tarsorrhaphy, medial or lateral canthoplasty, suspension procedures, and horizontal tightening procedures are useful.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Tarsorrhaphy can be performed &#173;either medially or laterally. An adequate temporary tarsorrhaphy (1–3 weeks) can be achieved with placement of nonabsorbable sutures between the upper and lower eyelid margins. A “temporary tarsorrhaphy” can also be created by injection of botulinum toxin into the levator muscle. Permanent tarsorrhaphy involves de-&#173;epithelialization of the upper and lower eyelid margins, avoiding the lash follicles. Absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures are then placed to unite the raw surfaces of the upper and lower eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-25">Fig&#160;12-25</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Occasionally, a fascia lata or silicone suspension sling of the lower eyelid may be indicated. Vertical elevation of the lower eyelid is useful in reducing exposure of the inferior cornea. This elevation may be accomplished through recession of the lower eyelid retractors, combined with use of a spacer graft. Surgical midface elevation can also play an impor&#173;tant role in lower eyelid support.</p>
				<p class="h2">Upper Eyelid Paralysis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upper eyelid loading remains the most commonly performed procedure for the treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos. The appropriate weight can be selected through a pro&#173;cess of preoperatively taping eyelid weights of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent sizes to the upper eyelid skin to determine which one best achieves adequate relaxed eyelid closure with minimal ptosis in primary gaze. &#173;After the weight is selected, it is inserted through an upper eyelid crease incision and is &#173;either sutured to the anterior surface of the tarsal plate (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-26">Fig&#160;12-26</span>) or &#173;behind the orbital septum; the latter may avoid thickening of the pretarsal area. If orbicularis function returns, the weight can be removed easily. Weights made of gold and platinum allow for magnetic resonance imaging (7 Tesla or less). Nonsurgical options include eyelid splints and use of hyaluronic acid gel injection in the pretarsal and preseptal plane; &#173;these function as temporary weights in the upper eyelid. Brow ptosis repair and blepharoplasty, in addition to facial volume augmentation, may be considered &#173;after improvement of corneal exposure.</p>

			<div id="Chapt12_Top10">
				<p class="h2-h1">Benign Essential Blepharospasm</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a bilateral focal dystonia that affects approximately 30 of &#173;every 100,000 &#173;people. The condition is characterized by increased blinking and involuntary spasms of the periocular protractor muscles (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-8</span>). The spasms generally start as mild twitches and pro&#173;gress over time to forceful contractures. Other muscles of the face may also be involved with blepharospasm. Unlike hemifacial spasm, BEB typically abates during sleep. The involuntary episodes of forced blinking or contracture may severely limit the patient’s ability to drive, read, or perform activities of daily living. &#173;Women are affected more frequently than men. The age of onset is usually older than 40&#160;years. BEB is a clinical diagnosis, and neuroimaging is rarely indicated in the workup. BEB must be differentiated from <span class="italic">reflex blepharospasm,</span> which can occur secondary to dry eye syndrome and other medical conditions.</p>

				<p class="body-text">The cause of BEB is unknown; however, it is prob&#173;ably of central origin, in the basal ganglia. BEB can be managed by medical or surgical approaches. Neurotoxin injections are the primary treatment for blepharospasm. (See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;5</span>, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span>)</p>
				<p class="h3">Botulinum toxin injection</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Repeated periodic injection of one of the botulinum toxin type A formulations is the treatment of choice for BEB (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-27">Fig&#160;12-27</span>). Injection of &#173;these agents at therapeutic doses results in chemical denervation (also called <span class="italic">chemodenervation</span>) and localized muscle paralysis. Botulinum toxin injection is typically effective, but the improvement is temporary. Average onset of action is in 2–3 days, and average peak effect occurs at about 7–10 days &#173;after injection. Duration of effect also varies but is typically 3–4 months, at which point recurrence of the spasms and need for reinjection is anticipated. Complications associated with botulinum toxin injection include bruising, blepharoptosis, ectropion, epiphora, diplopia, lagophthalmos, and corneal exposure. &#173;These adverse reactions are usually transient and result from spread of the toxin to adjacent muscles. Tachyphylaxis can also develop.</p>
				<p class="h3">Surgical myectomy</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment with surgical myectomy is reserved for patients with severe spasms who do not respond adequately to botulinum therapy. Meticulous removal of the orbital and palpebral orbicularis muscle in the upper (and sometimes lower) eyelids can be an effective and permanent treatment for blepharospasm. Complications of surgical myectomy include lagophthalmos, chronic lymphedema, and periorbital contour deformities. &#173;Limited upper eyelid protractor myectomy is helpful in patients with less severe disease. Recurrence of spasm is not uncommon &#173;after myectomy, and treatment with reduced dosage of botulinum toxin is indicated.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Many patients with BEB have an associated dry eye condition that may be aggravated by any treatment modality that decreases eyelid closure. Artificial tears, ointments, punctal plugs or occlusion, moisture chamber goggles and tinted (FL-41) spectacle lenses may help minimize discomfort from ocular surface prob&#173;lems.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Muscle relaxants and sedatives</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Muscle relaxants and sedatives are rarely effective in the primary treatment of BEB. Oral medi&#173;cations such as orphenadrine, lorazepam, and clonazepam are sometimes effective in suppressing mild cases of BEB, prolonging the interval between botulinum toxin injections, or helping to dampen oromandibular dystonia associated with BEB. Psychotherapy has &#173;little or no value for the patient with blepharospasm.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Hemifacial Spasm</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blepharospasm should be differentiated from hemifacial spasm (HFS). HFS is characterized by intermittent synchronous gross contractures of the entire side of the face and is rarely bilateral (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-9</span>). HFS often begins in the periocular region and then progresses to involve the entire half of the face. Unlike&#160;BEB, HFS persists during sleep.</p>

				<p class="body-text">HFS is often associated with ipsilateral facial nerve weakness. In most cases, HFS is the result of a vascular compression of the facial nerve root exit zone at the brain stem. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often reveals the ectatic vessel. MRI can also help rule out other cerebellopontine &#173;angle lesions that may be the cause in less than 1% of cases. Neurosurgical decompression of the facial nerve may be curative in HFS, but it carries significant associated risks. Periodic injection of botulinum toxin is a commonly used, effective treatment option for HFS (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-27</span>). Oral medi&#173;cations, including drugs with membrane-&#173;stabilizing properties such as carbamazepine and clonazepam, are used less frequently &#173;because of their low efficacy.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Aberrant regeneration &#173;after facial nerve palsy may also pre&#173;sent with hemifacial contracture and synkinetic facial movements. The history (eg, previous Bell palsy, trauma) and clinical examination are distinctive. Neuroimaging is indicated to rule out a mass lesion. Functionally troublesome synkinetic facial movements often respond well to botulinum toxin injection.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-16">Involutional Periorbital Changes</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top11">
				<p class="h2-h1">Dermatochalasis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dermatochalasis refers to redundancy of eyelid skin and is often associated with orbital fat prolapse (see <span class="xref-figure-local" id="Fig 12-18">Fig&#160;12-18</span>). Patients with significant dermatochalasis of the upper eyelids may report a heavy feeling around the eyes, brow-&#173;ache or headache, eyelashes in the visual axis, and reduction in the superior visual field. Dermatochalasis is often exacerbated by brow ptosis. Lower eyelid dermatochalasis is considered a cosmetic issue &#173;unless the excess skin and prolapsed fat are so severe that the patient cannot be fitted with bifocals.</p>
				<p class="h2">Blepharochalasis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although blepharochalasis is not an involutional change, it is included in this discussion &#173;because it can resemble, and must be differentiated from, dermatochalasis. Blepharochalasis is a rare familial variant of angioneurotic edema. It occurs most commonly in &#173;women younger than 40&#160;years and is characterized by idiopathic episodes of inflammatory edema of the eyelids. As a result of recurrent bouts of inflammation and edema, the eyelid skin becomes thin and wrinkled, simulating the appearance of dermatochalasis. In addition, true ptosis, herniation of the orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland, atrophy of the orbital fat pads, and prominent eyelid vascularity may be associated with blepharochalasis. Surgical repair of the eyelid skin changes and ptosis associated with blepharochalasis may be complicated by repeated episodes of inflammation and edema.</p>

			<div id="Chapt12_Top12">
				<p class="h2-h1">Upper Eyelid</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upper blepharoplasty is one of the most commonly performed oculoplastic procedures (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;12-10</span>). Involutional skin and structural changes often begin in the periorbital area, and they can obstruct the superior visual field. Blepharoplasty is frequently performed to relieve this obstruction. Brow ptosis may also play a role and may need to be addressed. Functional indications for blepharoplasty are documented by means of external photography and visual field testing with and without manual eyelid elevation. Patients undergoing blepharoplasty for cosmetic reasons may have dif&#173;fer&#173;ent expectations than &#173;those undergoing functional blepharoplasty. Thus, a thorough preoperative discussion of the anticipated results is critical to preoperative planning.</p>

				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Lower Eyelid</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lower blepharoplasty is most commonly performed for cosmetic indications. However, some patients undergo this procedure &#173;because of functional concerns such as difficulty reading, which can occur when prolapsed orbital fat and skin cover the bifocal spectacle segment. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span> for more details regarding management.</p>
				<p class="h2">Preoperative Evaluation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaluation of any potential blepharoplasty patient includes the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">complete ocular examination that includes visual acuity testing and documentation</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">history of prior periocular surgery or injections</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">identification of amount and areas of excess skin, as well as the amount and contours of prolapsed orbital fat, in the upper and lower eyelids</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">presence or absence of lagophthalmos, which can lead to postoperative dryness and exposure keratopathy</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">evaluation of tear secretion or the tear film, which may be carried out through Schirmer testing, tear breakup time assessment, or assessment of the adequacy of the tear meniscus</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">photographic documentation</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Upper blepharoplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to the assessments above, the examination before upper blepharoplasty includes the following ele&#173;ments:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">visual field testing to determine the presence and degree of superior visual field defects (if needed for documentation)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">evaluation of the forehead and eyebrows (including brow height and contour) to detect forehead and brow ptosis; the surgeon should make careful observations when the patient’s facial and brow musculature is relaxed</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">notation of the position of the upper eyelid crease</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">evaluation for concomitant upper eyelid ptosis</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Lower blepharoplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span> for discussion of lower blepharoplasty.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Techniques</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A thorough working knowledge of periorbital and eyelid anatomy (discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>) is essential for successful blepharoplasty. Just as the brow and glabellar areas affect the upper eyelids, the midfacial structures influence the position, tone, contour, and function of the lower eyelids and must be considered in surgical planning.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Surgical preparation involves marking excess skin for excision prior to infiltration of local anesthetic. The surgeon can determine the amount of skin to be excised by grasping the upper eyelid skin with toothless forceps and identifying the amount of redundancy <span class="italic">(pinch technique).</span> To avoid excessive skin removal, the surgeon usually leaves at least 20&#160;mm of skin remaining between the inferior border of the brow and the upper eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-28">Fig&#160;12-28</span>).</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Upper blepharoplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upper blepharoplasty begins with the surgeon incising along the lines marked on the upper eyelid. The surgeon removes skin and then may selectively remove orbicularis and a conservative amount of orbital fat to reshape the upper eyelid. Adjunctive procedures to re-&#173;form or create a new eyelid crease (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-29">Fig&#160;12-29</span>) and reposition the lacrimal gland may be necessary.</p>
				<p class="h2">Complications</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although it is rare, <span class="italic">loss of vision</span> is the most dreaded complication of blepharoplasty and is usually associated with <span class="italic">lower</span> blepharoplasty. Such blindness is typically thought to occur secondary to postoperative retrobulbar hemorrhage, with the increased intraorbital pressure causing ischemic compression of the ciliary arteries, which supply the optic nerve. Other mechanisms of injury include ischemia caused by excessive surgical retraction or constriction of retrobulbar blood vessels in response to epinephrine in the local anesthetic. Orbital hemorrhage may result from injury to the deeper orbital blood vessels or from bleeding anteriorly. Risk &#173;factors for this complication include hypertension, blood dyscrasias, and anticoagulant use. Postoperative pressure dressings should be avoided: they increase orbital pressure and obscure under&#173;lying prob&#173;lems.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Patients should be observed immediately postoperatively to detect pos&#173;si&#173;ble orbital hemorrhage. &#173;Those with significant pain, marked asymmetric swelling, or new proptosis should be evaluated. In addition, visual dimming or darkness or significant or asymmetric blurred vision following eyelid surgery may indicate orbital hemorrhage and should be assessed and treated immediately (see the discussion of orbital compartment syndrome in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span> for management).</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Excessive removal of skin</span> is a complication that can lead to lagophthalmos as well as cicatricial ectropion or eyelid retraction. Topical lubricants and massage may be helpful for managing mild postoperative lagophthalmos, retraction, or ectropion, all of which may resolve over time. Injectable ste&#173;roids or 5-&#173;fluorouracil can be used if a deep cicatrix contributes to the retraction. Severe cases require the use of &#173;free skin grafts, spacer grafts, lateral canthoplasty, or surgical release of scar tissue or eyelid retractors.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Brow Ptosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top13">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Loss of elastic tissues and facial volume, as well as involutional changes of the forehead skin, lead to drooping of the forehead and eyebrows. This condition is known as <span class="italic">brow ptosis.</span> Severe brow ptosis may also result from facial nerve palsy. Brow ptosis frequently accompanies dermatochalasis and must be recognized as a &#173;factor that contributes to the appearance of aging in the periorbital area. If severe, brow ptosis may impinge on the superior visual field (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-30">Fig&#160;12-30</span>). The patient often involuntarily compensates for this condition by using the frontalis muscle to elevate the eyebrows. Such chronic contracture of the frontalis muscle often leads to brow-&#173;ache, headache, and prominent static transverse forehead rhytids.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In most individuals, the brow is located at the level of or above the superior orbital rim. Generally, the female brow is higher and more arched than the typical male brow. The brow is considered ptotic when it falls below the superior orbital rim.</p>
				<p class="h2">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Brow ptosis should be recognized and treated prior to or concomitant with the surgical repair of coexisting dermatochalasis of the eyelids. &#173;Because brow elevation reduces the amount of dermatochalasis pre&#173;sent, it should be performed or simulated first when combined with upper blepharoplasty. Aggressive upper blepharoplasty alone in a patient with concomitant brow ptosis leads to further depression of the brow. Brow ptosis may be corrected with browpexy, direct brow elevation, or an endoscopic or pretrichial brow-&#173; and forehead-&#173;lift. See the section&#160;Forehead Rejuvenation in Chapter&#160;13 for details on endoscopic and open brow-&#173; and forehead-&#173;lifts.</p>
				<p class="h3">Browpexy</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Browpexy is used for treatment of mild brow ptosis and is performed through an upper eyelid blepharoplasty incision. The sub-&#173;brow tissues are resuspended with sutures to the frontal bone periosteum above the orbital rim as part of a blepharoplasty. Although this procedure provides minimal improvement in brow position, it can help prevent the retro–&#173;orbicularis oculi fat from descending into the eyelid (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>, Fig&#160;9-22).</p>
				<p class="h3">Direct brow elevation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The brows can be elevated with incisions placed at the upper edge of the brow hairs. This is an effective technique for treatment of brow ptosis and is particularly useful for men and &#173;women with lateral brow ptosis. When direct eyebrow elevation is used across the entire brow, it may result in an arch or displeasing scar. Sensory paresthesias may be an adverse effect of the direct brow procedure.</p>
