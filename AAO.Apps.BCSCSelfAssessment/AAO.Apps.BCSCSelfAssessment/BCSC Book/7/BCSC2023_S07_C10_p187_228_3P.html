			<p class="h1">Congenital Anomalies</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital anomalies of the eyelid may be isolated or associated with other eyelid, facial, or systemic anomalies. Careful evaluation of patients with hereditary syndromes is helpful before proceeding with treatment. Most congenital anomalies of the eyelids are rare and occur during the second month of gestation as a result of developmental arrest or failure of fusion. (See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;6</span>, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>)</p>
				<p class="h2">Blepharophimosis–&#173;Ptosis–&#173;Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blepharophimosis–&#173;ptosis–&#173;epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), also called <span class="italic">blepharophimosis syndrome,</span> is typically autosomal dominant in inheritance, although sporadic variants can occur. Classic findings include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">blepharophimosis (profound shortening of the horizontal palpebral fissures)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">severe bilateral ptosis, often with poor levator function</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">epicanthus inversus (a fold of skin extending from the lower eyelid to the medial canthus)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">telecanthus (increased soft-&#173;tissue distance between the medial canthi)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">The syndrome is caused by variants in the <span class="italic">FOXL2</span> gene, located on chromosome 3. &#173;There are 2 types of BPES (types I and II), and both involve abnormalities of the eyelids. In addition to the characteristics listed above, findings may include lateral lower eyelid ectropion secondary to vertical eyelid deficiency, flat nasal bridge, superior orbital rim hypoplasia, ear deformities, high-&#173;arched eyebrows, and hypertelorism (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-1">Fig&#160;10-1</span>). Type I is also associated with premature ovarian failure and infertility or reduced fertility in &#173;women.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Multiple surgical procedures may be required and are often performed in a staged fashion, but a priority should be the timely prevention of amblyopia due to visually obstructive ptosis. Medial canthal repositioning is typically addressed first with multiple Z-&#173;plasties (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-2">Fig&#160;10-2</span>) or with Y–&#173;V-&#173;plasties, sometimes combined with repositioning of the medial canthal tendons via transnasal wiring or suture fixation to a plate; however, horizontal traction on the upper eyelid may exacerbate the ptosis. Surgery for correction of ptosis often requires a frontalis sling due to poor levator function. Other procedures may be necessary to address ectropion or orbital rim hypoplasia.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Ptosis of the Upper Eyelid</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital ptosis of the upper eyelid is discussed in Chapter&#160;12.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Ectropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital ectropion rarely occurs as an isolated finding. It is more often associated with BPES, Down syndrome, or ichthyosis, a condition characterized by dry, scaly, and thickened skin. Congenital ectropion is caused by a vertical insufficiency of the anterior lamella of the eyelid and may give rise to chronic epiphora and exposure keratitis. Mild congenital ectropion usually requires no treatment. If the condition is severe and symptomatic, surgical correction is similar to that used for cicatricial ectropion, with vertical lengthening of the anterior lamella with full-&#173;thickness skin grafting, and, frequently, horizontal tightening of the lateral canthal tendon.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Complete eversion of the upper eyelids occasionally occurs in newborns (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-3">Fig&#160;10-3</span>). Pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;causes include anterior lamellar inflammation or shortage, inclusion conjunctivitis, and Down syndrome. Topical lubrication and short-&#173;term patching of both eyes may be curative. Full-&#173;thickness sutures or temporary tarsorrhaphy is used when necessary, followed by definitive repair.</p>
				<p class="h2">Euryblepharon</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Euryblepharon is characterized by horizontal lengthening of the lower eyelids and may be associated with BPES (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-4">Fig&#160;10-4A</span>). The lateral portion of the eyelid is typically more involved, having a downward slant and lateral ectropion due to an inferiorly displaced lateral canthal tendon. Impaired blinking and lagophthalmos may lead to exposure keratitis. If the condition &#173;causes symptoms, reconstruction may include lateral canthal repositioning along with suspension of the suborbicularis oculi fat to the lateral orbital rim to support the lower eyelid. If excess horizontal length is pre&#173;sent, a lateral tarsal strip or eyelid margin resection may be required. Occasionally, skin grafts may be necessary.</p>
				<p class="h2">Ankyloblepharon</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ankyloblepharon is a partial <span class="italic">(ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum)</span> or complete fusion of the eyelid margins (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-4">Fig&#160;10-4B</span>). &#173;These webs of skin can usually be opened with scissors &#173;after being clamped for a few seconds with a hemostat. In severe cases, under&#173;lying ocular abnormalities may exist.</p>
				<p class="h2">Epiblepharon</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epiblepharon is most common in &#173;children of Asian or Hispanic heritage. In this condition, the lower eyelid pretarsal muscle and skin &#173;ride above the lower eyelid margin to form a horizontal fold of tissue, causing the cilia to assume a vertical position (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-4">Fig&#160;10-4C</span>). Pathophysiologically, this condition results from a deficiency in the attachment of the lower eyelid retractors (capsulopalpebral fascia) to the skin. The cilia often do not touch the cornea except in downgaze, and this rarely &#173;causes corneal staining. Epiblepharon may not require surgical treatment, &#173;because it tends to diminish with the maturation of the facial bones. However, it occasionally results in acute or chronic corneal epithelial irritation; in that case, a repair is performed by excision of the excess skin and pretarsal orbicularis muscle with or without placement of marginal rotation sutures.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-2">Woo&#160;KI, Kim&#160;YD. Management of epiblepharon: state of the art. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Curr Opin Ophthalmol.</span> 2016;27(5):433–438.</p>
				<p class="h2">Epicanthus</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epicanthus is a medial canthal fold that may result from immature midfacial bones or a fold of skin and subcutaneous tissue. The condition is usually bilateral, and an affected child may appear esotropic &#173;because of decreased scleral exposure nasally <span class="italic">(pseudostrabismus).</span> Traditionally, 4 types of epicanthus have been described (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-5">Fig&#160;10-5</span>):</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">epicanthus tarsalis,</span> in which the fold is most prominent in the upper eyelid</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">epicanthus inversus,</span> in which the fold is most prominent in the lower eyelid</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">epicanthus palpebralis,</span> in which the fold involves the upper and lower eyelids equally</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">epicanthus supraciliaris,</span> in which the fold extends from the eyebrow region to the lacrimal sac</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Epicanthus tarsalis can be a normal variation of the Asian eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-6">Fig&#160;10-6</span>), whereas epicanthus inversus is often associated with BPES (see Fig&#160;10-1).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Most forms of epicanthus become less apparent with normal growth of the facial bones. If no associated eyelid anomalies are pre&#173;sent, observation is recommended &#173;until the face achieves maturity. Epicanthus inversus, however, rarely resolves with facial growth. Most cases of isolated epicanthus requiring treatment are corrected by soft-&#173;tissue revisions such as Z-&#173;plasty or Y–&#173;V-&#173;plasty (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-7">Fig&#160;10-7</span>). Epicanthus tarsalis in a patient of Asian heritage may be eliminated by a Y–&#173;V-&#173;plasty with or without the formation of an upper eyelid crease.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Entropion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In contrast to epiblepharon, eyelid margin inversion is pre&#173;sent in congenital entropion. Developmental &#173;factors that lead to this rare condition include lower eyelid retractor dysgenesis, structural defects in the tarsal plate, and relative shortening of the posterior lamella. Unlike epiblepharon, congenital entropion is unlikely to improve spontaneously and may require surgical correction. Congenital entropion may be repaired by removing a small amount of the skin and orbicularis muscle along the subciliary portion of the eyelid, advancing the lower eyelid retractors to the tarsus, and lengthening the posterior lamella.</p>
				<p class="h3">Congenital tarsal kink</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A tarsal kink (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-8">Fig&#160;10-8</span>) is an unusual form of congenital entropion in which the upper eyelid tarsal plate is folded, resulting in entropion. &#173;There is typically an absent eyelid crease and a corneal opacity or infiltrate may be pre&#173;sent as well. It may be repaired by removal of the kink and/or tarsotomy with marginal rotation. In some cases, skin grafting for the anterior lamella may be necessary.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Distichiasis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Distichiasis is a rare, sometimes hereditary condition in which an extra row of eyelashes is pre&#173;sent in place of the meibomian gland orifices. Congenital distichiasis occurs when embryonic pilosebaceous units improperly differentiate into hair follicles (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-9">Fig&#160;10-9</span>). Treatment is indicated if the patient is symptomatic or if keratopathy develops. Lubricants and soft contact lenses may be sufficient; if not, electrolysis, radiofrequency ablation, and eyelid splitting with the removal of the follicles are alternatives. Cryoepilation is used less often &#173;because of the risk of eyelid margin thinning or notching, eyelash loss, and skin hypopigmentation.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Coloboma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A <span class="italic">coloboma</span> is an embryologic cleft that is usually an isolated anomaly when it occurs in the medial upper eyelid. A true coloboma includes a defect in the eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-10">Fig&#160;10-10</span>). When located in the lower eyelid, however, a coloboma is frequently associated with other congenital conditions such as facial clefts (eg, Goldenhar syndrome) and lacrimal deformities.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Full-&#173;thickness defects affecting up to one-&#173;third of the eyelid can usually be repaired by creating raw vertical margins and sliding flaps along the eyelid crease. A lateral cantholysis may provide additional horizontal relaxation. Almost all large defects can be repaired with the use of a variation of the lateral canthal semicircular flap technique (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span> in this volume). &#173;Because of the risk of amblyopia, eyelid-&#173;sharing procedures that occlude the visual axis are avoided &#173;unless no other reconstructive options are pos&#173;si&#173;ble.</p>
				<p class="h2">Cryptophthalmos</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cryptophthalmos is a rare condition that pre&#173;sents with partial or complete absence of the eyebrow, palpebral fissure, eyelashes, and conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-11">Fig&#160;10-11</span>). The partially developed adnexa are fused to the anterior segment of the globe. Cryptophthalmos may be unilateral or bilateral. Histologically, the orbicularis oculi, levator muscle, tarsus, conjunctiva, and meibomian glands are attenuated or absent; thus, attempts at reconstruction are difficult. Severe ocular defects are pre&#173;sent in the under&#173;lying eye, which can be microphthalmic or associated with an orbital cyst.</p>
				<p class="h2">Congenital Eyelid Lesions: Infantile Hemangioma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although infantile hemangiomas (formerly known as capillary hemangiomas) sometimes occur as congenital eyelid lesions, most are not apparent at birth. In the typical natu&#173;ral course, the lesion usually develops within a few weeks or months &#173;after birth, increases in size over the first year, and gradually involutes during the next 3–7&#160;years. Hemangiomas may also involve the orbit (see the section&#160;Vascular Tumors, Malformations, and Fistulas in Chapter&#160;5 of this volume).</p>
				<p class="h3">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemangiomas are associated with a high incidence of amblyopia; therefore, treatment is recommended for patients who pre&#173;sent with occlusion of the visual axis, anisometropia, or strabismus, as well as for lesions causing significant disfigurement. Lesions &#173;limited to the eyelid may be treated with topical timolol gel or intralesional ste&#173;roids. Topical timolol gel appears to have minimal adverse effects. If vision is threatened or if &#173;there is more widespread or deeper orbital involvement, systemic propranolol or oral corticosteroids are typically required.</p>
				<p class="body-text">For patients who cannot take <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers or do not respond to timolol, intralesional ste&#173;roids are considered. Intralesional ste&#173;roids, which may act by rendering the tumor’s vascular bed more sensitive to the body’s circulating catecholamines, are relatively safe and effective. However, rare cases of eyelid necrosis, fat atrophy, embolic ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusion, and systemic adrenal suppression may occur &#173;after even a single injection. Although treatment with systemic ste&#173;roids eliminates the risks of eyelid necrosis and vascular emboli, the dosage and risk of systemic adverse effects are increased.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Other treatment options may be considered for vision-&#173;compromising lesions that persist despite intervention. Topical treatment with clobetasol propionate has been reported to successfully shrink eyelid hemangiomas. Compared with oral or intralesional ste&#173;roids, the topical route reduces, although does not eliminate, the risk of systemic exposure. Interferon-&#173;alfa is reserved for life-&#173;threatening or sight-&#173;threatening lesions unresponsive to other forms of treatment &#173;because of the risk of serious adverse effects. Surgical excision may be used for rare well-&#173;circumscribed lesions, but it requires meticulous control of hemostasis. The use of a carbon dioxide &#173;laser as an incisional device helps control bleeding during the removal of a lesion. Vascular &#173;lasers, such as the pulsed dye &#173;laser, may be used on the superficial (1–2&#160;mm) layers of the skin to diminish the redness of a lesion, but they do not penetrate deeply enough to shrink a visually disabling lesion.</p>

			<p class="h1">Acquired Eyelid Disorders</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
				<p class="h2-h1">Chalazion</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A chalazion is a focal, painless nodule on the eyelid that results from obstructed sebaceous glands (meibomian glands or glands of Zeis; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-12">Fig&#160;10-12</span>). This common disorder occurs in all age groups, is caused by lipogranulomatous inflammation vis&#173;i&#173;ble on histology, and is often associated with conditions such as rosacea and chronic blepharitis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">meibomian glands</span> are oil-&#173;producing sebaceous glands located in the tarsal plate. The oil is an essential component of the tear film. If the gland orifices on the eyelid margin become plugged, the contents of the glands <span class="italic">(sebum)</span> accumulate within the tarsus causing an inflammatory reaction.</p>
				<p class="h3">Management</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the acute inflammatory phase, the primary treatment consists of warm compresses applied several times per day and appropriate eyelid hygiene, which can consist of eyelid wipes, scrubs, or cleansing using baby shampoo, tea tree oil cleanser, or hypochlorous acid. Topical antibiotic eyedrops or ointments may be helpful in cases of significant blepharitis. In complex or recurrent cases, oral doxycycline or azithromycin may be considered &#173;because of their ability to modulate the expression of inflammatory mediators (matrix metalloproteinases, collagen production, interleukin-1, nitric oxide, and activated B cells), inhibiting bacterial lipase production and thereby improving the tear film balance. Tetracyclines are contraindicated in &#173;children and during pregnancy and may be associated with allergy, gastrointestinal distress, photosensitivity, and drug re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Chronic, per&#173;sis&#173;tent chalazia that have failed conservative management may require surgery or an intralesional injection for resolution. For surgical management, when the greatest inflammatory response is on the posterior eyelid, a chalazion clamp is applied, the eyelid is everted, and an 11 blade can be used to make a vertical incision through the tarsal plate. A curette is used to remove the lipogranulomatous material, and the pseudocapsule can be sharply excised (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-13">Fig&#160;10-13</span>, <span class="xref-video">Video&#160;10-1</span>). Caution is required when inflammatory tissue is removed at the eyelid margin or adjacent to the punctum. In rare cases, the inflammatory response is more severe on the anterior eyelid; in such cases, a skin incision is used. Given the risk of masquerade conditions, including sebaceous carcinoma that can mimic a chronic, recurrent chalazion, pathologic examination is appropriate for aty&#173;pi&#173;cal or recurrent chalazia.</p>

				<p class="body-text">Intralesional injection of corticosteroids is a nonsurgical treatment for chalazia that have failed conservative management. However, intralesional ste&#173;roid injections carry the risk of skin depigmentation, dermal atrophy, fat atrophy, and intra-&#173;arterial embolism that can rarely lead to central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion and vision loss. The combination of excision and ste&#173;roid injection yields a 95% resolution rate.</p>

				<p class="h2">Hordeolum</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A hordeolum is an acute infection (usually staphylococcal) associated with obstructed sebaceous glands in the eyelid. It pre&#173;sents as an erythematous, tender nodule and is often associated with eyelid edema, superficial skin exfoliation, crusting, or even cellulitis or abscess formation. It can have a whitish appearance like a pimple filled with purulent material. It can involve the glands of Zeis <span class="italic">(external hordeolum,</span> or <span class="italic">stye)</span> at the eyelid margin or the meibomian glands <span class="italic">(internal hordeolum)</span> within the tarsus. In the case of external hordeola, the infection may appear to center around an eyelash follicle, and the eyelash can be epilated to promote drainage (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-14">Fig&#160;10-14</span>). Like chalazia, most hordeola resolve spontaneously, but the diligent application of hot compresses and topical antibiotic ointment may be helpful. Systemic antibiotics such as doxycycline that cover staphylococcal infections are indicated in cases with associated cellulitis, abscess, or diffuse inflammation. Surgical drainage of a pointing hordeolum or abscess may be required; this can accelerate resolution and allow culturing of the purulent material.</p>
				<p class="h2">Eyelid Edema</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid edema can be caused by local conditions, such as insect bites or allergy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-15">Fig&#160;10-15</span>); systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease, thyroid eye disease, and collagen vascular disease; or other inflammatory or neoplastic orbital conditions, such as lymphoma. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage into the orbit and eyelids &#173;after trauma may mimic eyelid edema. Lymphedema may occur if the lymphatic drainage system from the eyelid is disrupted, such as &#173;after extensive lymph node dissection of the neck (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-16">Fig&#160;10-16</span>).</p>
				<p class="h2">Floppy Eyelid Syndrome</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Floppy eyelid syndrome is characterized by ocular irritation, redness, eyelash ptosis, loss of eyelash parallelism, and mild mucus discharge that is frequently worse on awakening (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-17">Fig&#160;10-17</span>). Patients have chronic papillary conjunctivitis and a superior tarsal plate that is rubbery and easily everted. Histologic examination has demonstrated a marked decrease in the number of elastin fibers within the tarsus. During an examination, the lax upper eyelid everts spontaneously, especially laterally, when pulled up &#173;toward the forehead. Patients often report sleeping in a prone position, which can cause mechanical upper eyelid eversion, with the superior palpebral conjunctiva rubbing against the pillow or bedding. Associations have been reported with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, keratoconus, eyelid rubbing, and hyperglycemia. Sleep studies are recommended to rule out sleep apnea.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Initial conservative treatment consists of viscous lubrication and a patch or shield at night. If warranted, surgical correction, which consists of wedge resection and horizontal eyelid tightening, can be undertaken. If the patient has been diagnosed with sleep apnea, the use of a continuous positive airway pressure device may reduce prone position sleeping and minimize recurrence &#173;after surgical correction.</p>
				<p class="h2">Eyelid Imbrication Syndrome</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid imbrication syndrome occurs when a lax upper eyelid with a normal tarsal plate overrides the lower eyelid margin during closure; this results in chronic mechanical conjunctivitis. Management consists of topical lubrication in mild cases. In more severe cases, horizontal tightening of the upper eyelid is indicated.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Trichotillomania</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trichotillomania is an impulse-&#173;control disorder most commonly seen in preteen or teenaged girls. It is characterized by the repeated desire to pull out hairs, frequently eyebrow cilia or eyelashes. Diagnosis may be elusive &#173;because affected patients usually deny the be&#173;hav&#173;ior; therefore, parental counseling or psychiatric consultation may be indicated. Characteristically, multiple hairs are broken off and regrow at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent lengths, a finding that guides the diagnosis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-18">Fig&#160;10-18</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Eyelid Neoplasms</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Numerous benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms can develop in the periocular skin, arising from the epidermis, dermis, or eyelid adnexal structures. Most lesions, &#173;whether benign or malignant, develop from the epidermis, the rapidly growing superficial layer of the skin. Although many of &#173;these lesions also occur elsewhere on the body, their appearance and be&#173;hav&#173;ior in the eyelids may be unique &#173;because of the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar characteristics of eyelid skin and the specialized adnexal ele&#173;ments. The malignant lesions that most frequently affect the eyelids are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Histologic examination of suspected cutaneous malignancies is recommended.</p>

				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lesions near the puncta should be evaluated for punctal or canalicular involvement. Probing and irrigation may be required to exclude lacrimal system involvement or to prepare for surgical reconstruction.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Palpable induration extending beyond visibly apparent margins suggests tumor infiltration into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Large lesions should be assessed for evidence of fixation to deeper tissues or bone. In addition, regional lymph nodes should be palpated for evidence of metastases in cases of suspected squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous cell carcinoma, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma. Lymphatic tumor spread may produce rubbery swelling along the jawline or in front of the ear. Restriction of ocular motility and proptosis suggest orbital extension. Assessment of the function of cranial nerves V and VII can reveal deficiencies that may indicate perineural tumor spread. Perineural invasion is a characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. Systemic evidence of liver, pulmonary, bone, or neurologic involvement should be sought in cases of sebaceous adenocarcinoma or melanoma of the eyelid. It is impor&#173;tant to obtain photo&#173;graphs and mea&#173;sure&#173;ments before treatment of the lesion.</p>

				<p class="h2">Benign Eyelid Lesions</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Epithelial hyperplasias</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The terminology used to describe benign epithelial proliferations, the most common type of benign eyelid lesions, continues to evolve. It is helpful to group &#173;these vari&#173;ous benign epithelial proliferations &#173;under the clinical heading of <span class="italic">papillomas.</span> (This designation does not necessarily imply any association with the papillomavirus.) Clinical and histologic characterizations of &#173;these lesions overlap considerably. Included within this group are seborrheic keratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, verruca vulgaris (wart), acrochordon (also called skin tag, fibroepithelial polyp, or squamous papilloma; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-19">Fig&#160;10-19</span>), basosquamous acanthoma, squamous acanthoma, and many &#173;others. All of &#173;these benign proliferations can be managed with shave excision at the dermal–&#173;epidermal junction.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Seborrheic keratosis</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-20">Fig&#160;10-20</span>) is an example of an acquired benign eyelid papilloma that tends to affect middle-&#173;aged and se&#173;nior patients. Its clinical appearance varies; it may be sessile or pedunculated and have varying degrees of pigmentation and hyperkeratosis. On facial skin, seborrheic keratosis typically appears as a smooth, greasy, stuck-on lesion. On the thinner eyelid skin, however, it can be more lobulated, papillary, or pedunculated, with vis&#173;i&#173;ble excrescences on its surface. &#173;These lesions can be managed by shave excision. A seborrheic keratosis involving a hair follicle, called an <span class="italic">inverted follicular keratosis,</span> may be more elevated and nodular (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-21">Fig&#160;10-21</span>) and can be confused with a keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia</span> is not a discrete lesion but rather a pattern of reactive changes in the epidermis that may develop over areas of inflammation or neoplasia.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Verruca vulgaris (wart),</span> caused by epidermal infection with the &#173;human papillomavirus (type 6 or 11), rarely occurs in thin eyelid skin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-22">Fig&#160;10-22</span>). Cryotherapy or excision may eradicate the lesion and minimize the risk of viral spread.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cutaneous horn</span> is a descriptive, nondiagnostic term referring to <span class="italic">exuberant hyperkeratosis</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-23">Fig&#160;10-23</span>)<span class="italic">.</span> This lesion may be associated with vari&#173;ous benign or malignant histologic pro&#173;cesses, including seborrheic keratosis, verruca vulgaris, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the base of the cutaneous horn is recommended.</p>
				<p class="h3">Benign epithelial lesions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After papillomas, cysts of the epidermis are the second most common type of benign periocular cutaneous lesions, accounting for approximately 18% of excised benign lesions. Most of &#173;these are <span class="italic">epidermal inclusion cysts,</span> which arise from the infundibulum of the hair follicle, &#173;either spontaneously or &#173;after traumatic implantation of epidermal tissue into the dermis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-24">Fig&#160;10-24</span>). The lesions are slow growing, elevated, round, and smooth. They often have a central pore, indicating the remaining pilar duct. Although &#173;these cysts are often called <span class="italic">sebaceous cysts,</span> they are actually filled with keratin. Rupture of the cyst wall may cause an inflammatory foreign-&#173;body reaction. The cysts may also become secondarily infected.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Recommended treatment for small cysts is excision or marsupialization, which involves excising around the periphery of the cyst but leaving the base of the cyst wall to serve as the new surface epithelium. Larger or deeper cysts may require complete excision, in which case the cyst wall should be removed intact to reduce the possibility of recurrence.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Multiple tiny epidermal inclusion cysts are called <span class="italic">milia</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-25">Fig&#160;10-25</span>). They are particularly common in newborn infants. Generally, milia resolve spontaneously, but they may be marsupialized with a sharp blade or needle. Multiple confluent milia may be treated with topical retinoic acid cream.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A less common epidermal cyst is the <span class="italic">pilar,</span> or <span class="italic">trichilemmal, cyst.</span> Such cysts are clinically indistinguishable from epidermal inclusion cysts, but they tend to occur in areas containing large and numerous hair follicles. Approximately 90% of pilar cysts occur on the scalp; in the periocular region, they are generally found in the eyebrows. The cysts are filled with desquamated epithelium, and calcification occurs in approximately 25% of cases.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Molluscum contagiosum</span> is a viral infection of the epidermis that often involves the eyelid in &#173;children with associated follicular conjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-26">Fig&#160;10-26</span>). Occasionally, multiple exuberant lesions appear in adult patients with HIV/AIDS. The lesions are characteristically waxy and nodular, with a central umbilication. They may produce associated follicular conjunctivitis. Treatment is observation, oral cimetidine, excision, controlled cryotherapy, or curettage. Biopsy showing characteristic molluscum bodies on histology can make a definitive diagnosis. (For histologic findings, see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span>)</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Xanthelasmas</span> are yellowish plaques that occur commonly in the medial canthal areas of the upper and lower eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-27">Fig&#160;10-27</span>). They represent lipid-&#173;laden macrophages in the superficial dermis and subdermal tissues. Deep extension into the orbicularis oculi muscle can occur. In rare instances, xanthelasmas are associated with hyperlipidemia or congenital disorders of lipid metabolism, so patients whose lipid levels are unknown may benefit from having them checked by their primary care physician. When excising &#173;these lesions, the surgeon must be careful to avoid causing cicatricial ectropion or eyelid retraction. Other treatment options include serial excision, &#173;laser ablation, and topical trichloroacetic acid. Xanthelasmas may commonly recur &#173;after excision.</p>
				<p class="h2">Benign Adnexal Lesions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In this context, the term <span class="italic">adnexa</span> refers to skin appendages that are located within the dermis but communicate through the epidermis to the surface. They include oil glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles. The eyelids contain both the specialized eyelashes and the normal vellus hairs found on the skin throughout the body. Periocular adnexal oil glands include</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">meibomian glands</span> within the tarsal plate</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">glands of Zeis,</span> associated with eyelash follicles</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">normal <span class="bullet-list_italic">sebaceous glands</span> that are pre&#173;sent as part of the pilosebaceous units in the skin hair</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sweat glands in the periocular region include the <span class="italic">eccrine sweat glands,</span> which have a general distribution throughout the body and are responsible for thermal regulation, and the ciliary glands with apocrine secretion (the <span class="italic">glands of Moll</span>), which are located in the eyelid margin.</p>
				<p class="h3">Lesions of oil gland origin</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Chalazion and hordeolum</span> &#173;These common eyelid lesions are discussed &#173;earlier in this chapter in the section&#160;Acquired Eyelid Disorders.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Sebaceous hyperplasia</span> Sebaceous hyperplasia pre&#173;sents as multiple flesh-&#173;colored or faintly yellow papules that may have central umbilication (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-28">Fig&#160;10-28</span>). They tend to occur on the forehead and cheeks and are common in patients older than 40&#160;years. &#173;These lesions are sometimes mistaken for basal cell carcinoma &#173;because they may have central umbilication and fine telangiectasias.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Sebaceous adenoma</span> This is a rare tumor that appears as a yellowish papule on the face, scalp, or trunk and may mimic a basal cell carcinoma or seborrheic keratosis (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-29">Fig&#160;10-29</span>). Patients with multiple acquired sebaceous gland adenomas, adenomatoid sebaceous hyperplasia, or basal cell carcinomas with sebaceous differentiation have an increased incidence of visceral malignancy <span class="h4-text_italic">(Muir-&#173;Torre syndrome [MTS])</span> and should be evaluated accordingly.</p>
				<p class="h3">Tumors of eccrine sweat gland origin</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Eccrine hidrocystoma</span> Eccrine hidrocystomas are common cystic lesions 1–3&#160;mm in diam&#173;eter that occur in groups and tend to cluster around the lower eyelids and canthi and on the face (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-30">Fig&#160;10-30</span>). They are considered to be ductal retention cysts, and they often enlarge in conditions such as heat and increased humidity, which stimulates perspiration. Treatment consists of surgical excision.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Syringoma</span> Syringomas are benign eccrine sweat gland tumors found commonly in female adolescents and adults. They pre&#173;sent as multiple small, waxy nodules 1–2&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and are most common on the lower eyelids, although the upper eyelids can be involved as well (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-31">Fig&#160;10-31</span>). Syringomas can also be found elsewhere on the body, such as in the axilla and sternal regions. They become more apparent during puberty. &#173;Because the eccrine glands are located within the dermis, &#173;these lesions are too deep to allow shave excision. They can be surgically excised or treated with ablative dermatological &#173;lasers.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A less common variant, <span class="italic">chondroid syringoma,</span> occurs most commonly in middle-&#173;aged men and can enlarge to 3&#160;cm. It is composed of sweat gland components within a mixed cartilaginous stroma.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pleomorphic adenoma</span> This rare benign tumor occurs most commonly in the head and neck region and may involve the eyelids (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-32">Fig&#160;10-32</span>). Histologically, the tumor is identical to pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary and lacrimal glands (discussed in Chapter&#160;5). Treatment is complete surgical excision.</p>
				<p class="h3">Tumors of apocrine sweat gland origin</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Apocrine hidrocystoma</span> A very common, smooth cyst arising from the glands of Moll along the eyelid margin, apocrine hidrocystoma is considered to be an adenoma of the secretory cells of Moll rather than a retention cyst (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-33">Fig&#160;10-33</span>). &#173;These lesions are typically translucent or bluish and they transilluminate. &#173;There may be multiple cysts and often extend deep beneath the surface, especially in the canthal regions. Treatment for superficial cysts is marsupialization. Deep cysts require complete excision of the cyst wall.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Cylindroma</span> Cylindromas <span class="h4-text_italic">(eccrine spiradenomas)</span> are rare tumors that can be solitary or multiple and may be dominantly inherited. Lesions are dome-&#173;shaped, smooth, flesh-&#173;colored nodules of varying sizes that tend to affect the scalp and face (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-34">Fig&#160;10-34</span>). They may occur so profusely in the scalp that it is entirely covered with lesions, in which case they are called <span class="h4-text_italic">turban tumors.</span> Treatment is surgical excision, which may be difficult if multiple lesions involve a large surface area.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Tumors of hair follicle origin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several rare benign lesions may arise from the eyelashes, eyebrows, or vellus hairs in the periocular region.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Trichoepithelioma</span> &#173;These lesions are small, flesh-&#173;colored papules with occasional telangiectasias that occur on the eyelids (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-35">Fig&#160;10-35A</span>) or forehead. Histologically, trichoepitheliomas appear as basaloid islands and keratin cysts with immature hair follicle structures. If keratin is abundant, &#173;these lesions may clinically resemble an epidermal inclusion cyst. The individual histologic picture may be difficult to differentiate from that of basal cell carcinoma. &#173;Simple excision is curative.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Trichoadenoma</span> A trichoadenoma is a benign, slow-&#173;growing tumor of the hair follicle that consists of multiple keratin-&#173;filled cysts and can sometimes appear like a basal cell carcinoma (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-35">Fig&#160;10-35B</span>).</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Trichofolliculoma</span> A trichofolliculoma is a single, sometimes umbilicated lesion found mainly in adults. Histologically, it represents a squamous cystic structure containing keratin and hair shaft components (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-35">Fig&#160;10-35C</span>).</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Trichilemmoma</span> Another type of solitary lesion that occurs predominantly in adults, trichilemmomas resemble verrucae (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-35">Fig&#160;10-35D</span>). Histologically, they show glycogen-&#173;rich cells oriented around hair follicles.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pilomatricoma</span> Also known as <span class="h4-text_italic">pilomatrixoma,</span> this lesion most often affects &#173;children and young adults. It usually occurs in the eyebrow and central upper eyelid as a nontender, reddish-&#173;purple, subcutaneous mass attached to the overlying skin (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-35">Fig&#160;10-35E</span>). Pilomatricomas may become quite large, mea&#173;sur&#173;ing up to 5&#160;cm or more. The tumor is composed of islands of epithelial cells surrounded by basophilic cells with shadow cells. Multiple lesions or familial cases may be associated with Gardner syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Turner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Rubinstein-&#173;Taybi syndrome. Excision is usually curative, and recurrence is rare.</p>
				<p class="h2">Benign Melanocytic Lesions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanocytic lesions of the skin arise from 3 sources: nevus cells, dermal melanocytes, and epidermal melanocytes. Virtually any benign or malignant lesion may be pigmented, and lesions of melanocytic origin do not necessarily have vis&#173;i&#173;ble pigmentation. For example, seborrheic keratoses are frequently pigmented, and basal cell carcinomas are occasionally pigmented, especially if they arise in persons with darker skin. In contrast, dermal nevi typically have no pigmentation in White individuals. Melanocytes are normally found distributed at the dermal–&#173;epidermal junction throughout the skin. Nevus cells are similar to melanocytes in that both produce melanin; however, nevus cells are arranged in clusters and nests and lack dendritic pro&#173;cesses (except for blue nevus cells). Both nevus cells and melanocytes give rise to several types of benign lesions (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 10-1">&#173;Table&#160;10-1</span>). In addition to the individual lesions described in the following paragraphs, diffuse eyelid and facial skin hyperpigmentation called <span class="italic">melasma,</span> or <span class="italic">chloasma,</span> can occur in &#173;women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptives; in families with an autosomal dominant trait; and in patients with chronic atopic eczema, rosacea, and other inflammatory dermatoses.</p>
				<p class="h3">Nevi</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nevi are the third most common benign lesions encountered in the periocular region (&#173;after papillomas and epidermal inclusion cysts). They arise from <span class="italic">nevus cells,</span> which are grouped as clusters in the basal epidermis and dermis and in the junction zone between &#173;these 2 layers. Nevi are not apparent clinically at birth but begin to appear during childhood and often develop increased pigmentation during puberty.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Over the course of a person’s lifetime, nevi evolve through 3 stages: (1) <span class="italic">junctional</span> (located in the basal layer of the epidermis at the dermal–&#173;epidermal junction), (2) <span class="italic">compound</span> (extending from the junctional zone up into the epidermis and down into the dermis), and (3) <span class="italic">intradermal</span> (caused by involution of the epidermal component and per&#173;sis&#173;tence of the dermal component). In &#173;children, nevi arise initially as junctional nevi, which are typically flat, pigmented macules. Beyond the second de&#173;cade of a person’s life, most nevi become compound, at which stage they appear as elevated, pigmented papules. &#173;Later in life, the pigmentation is lost, and the compound nevus remains as a minimally pigmented or amelanotic lesion (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-36">Fig&#160;10-36</span>). By the time a person is 70&#160;years, virtually all nevi have become intradermal nevi and have lost pigmentation. For histology illustrating the 3 stages of nevi, see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and </span><span class="italic">Intraocular Tumors</span>.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Nevi are frequently found on the eyelid margin and often mold to the ocular surface (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-37">Fig&#160;10-37</span>). Asymptomatic benign nevi require no treatment, but malignant transformation of a junctional or compound nevus can occur in rare cases. Nevi can also involve both the upper and lower eyelid margins (<span class="italic">kissing nevus,</span> <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-38">Fig&#160;10-38</span>). Nevi may become symptomatic if they rub on the ocular surface or enlarge and obstruct vision or lacrimal outflow. When amelanotic, they can be confused with basal cell tumors. They are managed with shave excision or wedge resection.</p>
				<p class="h3">Ephelis (freckle)</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An <span class="italic">ephelis,</span> or <span class="italic">freckle,</span> is a small, flat, brown spot that can occur on vari&#173;ous areas of the body and facial skin, including malar areas, nose, eyelids, or the conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-39">Fig&#160;10-39A</span>). Ephelides arise from hyperpigmentation of the basal layer of the epidermis. Although the number of epidermal melanocytes is not increased, they extrude more than the usual amount of pigment into the epidermal basal cell layer. Ephelides are common in fair-&#173;skinned persons, and the hue of the ephelis darkens with sunlight exposure. No treatment is necessary other than sun protection.</p>
				<p class="h3">Lentigo simplex</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">&#173;Simple lentigines</span> are flat, pigmented spots that are larger in dia&#173;meter than ephelides (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-39">Fig&#160;10-39B</span>). Lentigo simplex can occur at any age and is not related to sun exposure. The condition also differs from ephelides in that the number of epidermal melanocytes is increased, and melanin is found in adjacent basal keratinocytes. Individual lesions are evenly pigmented and mea&#173;sure a few millimeters in dia&#173;meter. Eyelid lentigines may be associated with <span class="italic">Peutz-&#173;Jeghers syndrome (autosomal dominant polyposis of the intestinal tract).</span> No treatment is necessary; however, melanin-&#173;bleaching topical agents may improve cosmesis.</p>
				<p class="h3">Solar lentigo</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple solar lentigines may occur in older persons, in which case they are called <span class="italic">age-&#173;related lentigo</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-39">Fig&#160;10-39C</span>). Chronic sun exposure produces pigmented macules with an increased number of melanocytes. Solar lentigines are uniformly hyperpigmented and somewhat larger than &#173;simple lentigines. The dorsum of the hands and the forehead are the most frequently affected areas. No treatment is necessary, but sun protection is recommended. Melanin-&#173;bleaching preparations, intense pulsed-&#173;light treatment, picosecond &#173;lasers, or cryotherapy may help fade the pigmentation of solar lentigines.</p>
				<p class="h3">Blue nevi</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blue nevi are dark blue-&#173;gray to blue-&#173;black, slightly elevated lesions that may be congenital or may develop during childhood (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-39">Fig&#160;10-39D</span>). They arise from a localized proliferation of dermal melanocytes. The dark, dome-&#173;shaped lesions beneath the epidermis are usually 10&#160;mm or less in dia&#173;meter. Although their malignant potential is extremely low, &#173;these lesions are generally excised.</p>
				<p class="h3">Oculodermal melanocytosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as <span class="italic">nevus of Ota,</span> this diffuse, congenital blue nevus of the periocular skin most often affects persons of African, Hispanic, or Asian descent, especially females. Dermal melanocytes proliferate in the region of the first and second dermatomes of cranial nerve V. The eyelid skin is diffusely brown, gray, or blue, and pigmentation may extend to the adjacent forehead and &#173;temple (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-40">Fig&#160;10-40A</span>). Approximately 5% of cases are bilateral. Patchy slate-&#173;gray pigmentation can be vis&#173;i&#173;ble on the conjunctiva, sclera, and uvea, as occurs in two-&#173;thirds of affected patients; the condition is known as <span class="italic">oculodermal melanocytosis</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-40">Fig&#160;10-40B</span>). Although cutaneous or ocular malignant transformation may occur, especially in White patients, no prophylactic treatment is recommended. Approximately 0.25% of patients with oculodermal melanocytosis develop a uveal melanoma. Patients should also be monitored for glaucoma &#173;because 10% of patients with oculodermal melanocytosis also have glaucoma and pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Premalignant Epidermal Lesions: Actinic Keratosis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Actinic keratosis is the most common precancerous skin lesion. It usually affects fair-&#173;skinned persons who are &#173;middle aged or older with a history of chronic sun exposure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-41">Fig&#160;10-41</span>). &#173;These lesions are typically round, scaly, keratotic plaques that on palpation have the texture of sandpaper. They often develop on the face, head, neck, forearms, and dorsal hands. &#173;These lesions are in a state of continual flux, increasing in size and darkening in response to sunlight and remitting with reduced sun exposure. It has been reported that up to 25% of individual actinic keratoses spontaneously resolve over 12 months, although new lesions tend to develop continually. The risk of malignant transformation of an individual actinic keratosis is only 0.24% per year, but during periods of extended follow-up, a person with multiple actinic keratoses has a 12%–20% risk of squamous cell carcinoma developing. Squamous cell carcinomas arising from actinic keratoses are thought to be less aggressive than &#173;those developing de novo. For lesions arising in the periocular region, incisional or excisional biopsy is recommended. Widespread lesions may be treated with topical 5-&#173;fluorouracil or imiquimod cream, cryotherapy, or photodynamic field therapy.</p>
				<p class="h2">In Situ Epithelial Malignancies</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Squamous cell carcinoma in situ</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) typically appears as an elevated, nonhealing, erythematous lesion. It may pre&#173;sent with scaling, crusting, or pigmented keratotic plaques. Pathologically, the lesions demonstrate full-&#173;thickness epidermal atypia without dermal invasion, in contrast to the partial thickness atypia of actinic keratoses. In 5% of patients, SCCIS may pro&#173;gress to vertically invasive squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, complete surgical excision is advised. Alternatively, electrodesiccation and curettage, cryotherapy, and 5-&#173;fluorouracil may be used, especially in larger areas of involvement.</p>
				<p class="h3">Keratoacanthoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratoacanthomas are considered a low-&#173;grade subtype of squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion usually begins as a flesh-&#173;colored papule on the lower eyelid that develops rapidly into a dome-&#173;shaped nodule with a central keratin-&#173;filled crater and elevated rolled margins (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-42">Fig&#160;10-42</span>). Keratoacanthomas typically occur in individuals who are middle-&#173;aged or older, and &#173;there is an increased incidence in immunosuppressed patients. Gradual involution over the course of 3–6 months has often been observed. The abundant keratin production in the center of the lesion may incite a surrounding inflammatory reaction, which may play a role in ultimate resolution. At pre&#173;sent, incisional biopsy followed by complete surgical excision is recommended. Intralesional methotrexate or 5-&#173;fluorouracil may be options for patients who are not surgical candidates.</p>
				<p class="h2">Premalignant Melanocytic Lesions: Lentigo Maligna</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as <span class="italic">Hutchinson melanotic freckle</span> or <span class="italic">precancerous melanosis,</span> lentigo maligna is a flat, irregularly &#173;shaped, unevenly pigmented, slowly enlarging lesion that typically occurs on the malar region (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-43">Fig&#160;10-43</span>). Risk &#173;factors include advanced age, lighter skin types, a tendency to develop solar lentigines, and a history of nonmelanoma skin malignancies. A history of intermittent severe sunburns, rather than cumulative sun exposure, is also considered a risk &#173;factor for lentigo maligna. Lentigo maligna is characterized by significant pigmentary variation, irregular borders, and progressive enlargement. The malignant melanotic cells are confined to the epidermis but can grow in a radial or intraepidermal pattern and can eventually pro&#173;gress to nodules of vertically invasive lentigo maligna melanoma. The absolute risk of a lentigo maligna melanoma (at any location) &#173;after a histologically confirmed lentigo maligna is low, at 2.0%–2.6%.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The area of histologic abnormality frequently extends beyond the vis&#173;i&#173;ble pigmented borders of the lesion; in the periocular region, cutaneous lentigo maligna of the eyelid may extend onto the conjunctival surface, where the lesion appears identical to primary acquired melanosis. Excision with adequate surgical margins is recommended, with permanent sections for final monitoring. Close observation for recurrence is warranted with photographic documentation.</p>
				<p class="h2">Malignant Eyelid Tumors</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Basal cell carcinoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common eyelid malignancy, accounts for approximately 90%–95% of malignant eyelid tumors. A prospective series of 1295 patients found that BCCs are most often located on the medial canthus (48.3%), lower eyelid (47.5%), and upper eyelid (3.9%). BCCs can have many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent clinical manifestations in the eyelid.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Patients at highest risk for BCC are fair-&#173;skinned, blue-&#173;eyed, red-&#173;haired or blond, and middle-&#173;aged and older with En&#173;glish, Irish, Scottish, or Scandinavian ancestry. A history of prolonged sun exposure during the first 2 de&#173;cades of life and a history of cigarette smoking also increase the risk of BCC formation. Patients with prior BCC have a higher probability of additional skin cancers developing. BCC can have a variety of clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-44">Fig&#160;10-44</span>) and types, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Nodular&#160;BCC,</span> which is the most common type and pre&#173;sents as a firm, raised, pearly nodule that may be associated with telangiectasia and central ulceration. Histologically, it shows nests of basal cells originating from the basal layer of the epidermis and may show peripheral palisading. As the nests of aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cells break through the epidermal surface, central necrosis and ulceration may occur.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Morpheaform&#160;BCC,</span> which is less common but more aggressive than nodular BCC. Morpheaform lesions may be firm and slightly elevated with margins that may be indeterminate on clinical examination. Histologically, they show thin cords that radiate peripherally rather than peripheral palisading. The surrounding stroma may show fibrotic proliferation of connective tissue.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Multicentric</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">superficial BCC</span>, which may be mistaken for chronic blepharitis and eyelid margin inflammation. It is frequently associated with madarosis and can silently extend along the eyelid margin.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Basosquamous carcinoma,</span> which is a rare, aggressive neoplasm with characteristics of BCC and squamous cell carcinoma. As compared with BCC, basosquamous carcinoma is more likely to have a local recurrence and lymph node or distant metastases.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">BCC is being seen with increasing frequency in younger patients, and the discovery of malignant eyelid lesions in &#173;these patients should prompt inquiry into pos&#173;si&#173;ble systemic associations such as basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome)</span> is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder characterized by multiple BCCs that can start in the second or third de&#173;cade of life. It is associated with skeletal abnormalities of the ribs and spine, odontogenic keratocysts (jaw cysts arising from degenerated dental lamina), palmar or plantar pits (punctiform reddish depressions in the skin), calcification of the falx cerebri (seen on X-&#173;ray), intestinal hamartomatous polyposis, and a variety of ocular manifestations (<span class="bullet-list_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-45">Fig&#160;10-45</span>).</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Xeroderma pigmentosum</span> is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sun sensitivity and a defective repair mechanism for UV light–&#173;induced DNA damage in skin cells (<span class="bullet-list_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-46">Fig&#160;10-46</span>).</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> A biopsy is necessary to confirm any clinical suspicion of BCC (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 10-47">Fig&#160;10-47</span>). The most accurate diagnosis is facilitated by obtaining an incisional biopsy specimen with the following features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">is representative of the clinically evident lesion</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">is large enough for histologic pro&#173;cessing</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">is not excessively traumatized, cauterized, or crushed</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">contains normal tissue at the margin to show the transitional area</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">The biopsy site should be first photographed &#173;because the site often heals so well that the original location can be difficult to find for subsequent tumor removal.</p>
				<p class="body-text">An <span class="italic">incisional biopsy</span>, in which only a portion of the lesion is biopsied<span class="italic">,</span> can be used as a confirmatory procedure if the suspected malignant tumor involves the eyelid margin or medial canthus or is especially large.</p>
				<p class="body-text">An <span class="italic">excisional biopsy</span> is reasonable when lesions are small and do not involve the eyelid margin or when eyelid margin lesions are away from the lateral canthus or lacrimal punctum. However, histologic monitoring of tumor borders to ensure complete excision is critical. The borders of any excisional biopsy should be marked in case the excision is incomplete and further resection is necessary. Excisional biopsies should be oriented vertically so that closure avoids vertical traction on the eyelid that could lead to eyelid retraction or ectropion. If the margins of the excised portion are positive for residual tumor cells, the involved eyelid area should be excised again, with surgical monitoring of the margins by Mohs micrographic technique or frozen section technique.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Surgery is the treatment of choice for all BCCs of the eyelid. Surgical excision affords the advantages of complete tumor removal with histologic control of the margins. The recurrence rate is lower with excision than with any other treatment modality. Surgical excision also offers superior cosmetic results in most cases.</p>
				<p class="body-text">When BCCs involve the medial canthal area, the lacrimal drainage system may need to be excised to completely eradicate the tumor. If the punctum or a canaliculus is excised, the drainage system can often be sal&#173;vaged and/or reconstructed by placing a stent. If the distal lacrimal drainage system must be sacrificed to clear tumor margins, reconstruction of the lacrimal outflow system is not undertaken &#173;until it is established that the patient is tumor-&#173;free.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The incidence of orbital invasion with BCC is 2%–4% and occurs most commonly in cases that have been inadequately treated, in clinically neglected tumors, in morpheaform tumors, or in tumors with perineural spread. Orbital exenteration may be required in such cases. Retrospective studies show that the mortality rate from ocular adnexal BCC is 3%. The vast majority of patients who have died from BCC had disease that started in the canthal area, had under&#173;gone prior radiation therapy, or had clinically neglected tumors.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Histologic examination of the margins of an excised malignant tumor should confirm complete tumor removal. During surgery, frozen section techniques can be used in which the clinically apparent tumor, along with 1–2&#160;mm margins, is excised, oriented on a detailed drawing, and sent to pathology for immediate frozen section evaluation.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Reconstruction is undertaken when all margins are found to be &#173;free of tumor. Some tumors have subcutaneous extensions that are not recognized preoperatively. Consequently, the surgeon must always be prepared to do a much larger reconstruction than originally anticipated from the clinical appearance of the tumor.</p>
				<p class="body-text">To facilitate complete removal of recurrent, infiltrative, morpheaform tumors and tumors in the medial canthus, dermatologists with special training in <span class="italic">Mohs micrographic surgery</span> can use this technique to remove thin layers of tumor via 3-&#173;dimensional mapping. This gives the highest success and clearance rates while minimizing defect size. Mohs surgery is indicated for any BCC on the eyelids and face and can also be used for squamous cell carcinoma. Preoperative planning involving both the micrographic surgeon and the oculoplastic surgeon enables the most efficient patient care. In some cases, micrographic excision may allow the globe to be retained, whereas conventional surgical techniques might indicate the need for exenteration. However, a limitation of Mohs micrographic surgery is in identifying the margins of the tumor if it has invaded orbital fat.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;After Mohs tumor resection, the eyelid should be reconstructed by the ophthalmologist. (Reconstruction techniques are reviewed in Chapter&#160;11.) Although urgent reconstruction is not critical, the procedure should be performed expeditiously. Early surgery affords maximum globe protection and fresh eyelid tissue margins for optimal reconstruction. If immediate reconstruction is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the cornea should be protected by patching or temporarily suturing the remaining eyelid closed over the globe. If defects are small, spontaneous granulation may be a treatment alternative.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Radiation therapy</span> should also be considered only as a palliative treatment and should generally be avoided for periorbital lesions. In par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, it should not be used for medial canthal lesions &#173;because of the risk of recurrence and orbital invasion. Histologic margins cannot be evaluated, and the recurrence rate is higher with radiation treatment compared with surgical treatment. Tumor recurrence &#173;after radiation is more difficult to detect &#173;because it occurs at a longer interval &#173;after initial treatment. Prior radiation makes surgical treatment more challenging &#173;because of the compromised blood supply and impaired healing. Adverse effects of radiation therapy in the periocular region include cicatricial changes of the skin/eyelids, scarring and obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and radiation-&#173;induced malignancy. Radiation may also cause cataract formation, retinopathy, or optic neuropathy. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;4</span>, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
				<p class="body-text">Oral vismodegib or sonidegib, hedgehog pathway inhibitors, may be useful treatments for metastatic or advanced orbital infiltrative BCC that is not amenable to surgical resection or radiation. Initial studies show that &#173;these drugs are effective, but long-&#173;term medi&#173;cation compliance can be challenging &#173;because of significant adverse effects, including muscle spasms, alopecia, change in taste, nausea, and diarrhea. Patients need to be carefully monitored for squamous cell carcinomas at uninvolved sites.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Cemiplimab, a checkpoint inhibitor targeting the protein programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), has been approved for treating advanced BCC in patients whose disease has progressed, or who have had no response to, or &#173;were intolerant of prior hedgehog pathway inhibitor treatment.</p>

				<p class="h3">Squamous cell carcinoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 20% of all cutaneous malignancies, but approximately 5%–10% of eyelid malignancies. Large longitudinal studies have shown that the age-&#173;adjusted incidence of SCC has increased by 200% in the past 3 de&#173;cades. Although less common than BCC of the eyelid, SCC is clinically more aggressive (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-48">Fig&#160;10-48</span>). Tumors can arise spontaneously or from areas of solar injury and actinic keratosis and may be potentiated by immunodeficiency/immunosuppression. Cutaneous SCC is the most common malignancy to occur &#173;after a solid organ transplant.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Treatment for SCC is similar to that for BCC. Mohs micrographic resection or surgical excision with wide margins and frozen sections is preferred &#173;because of the potentially lethal nature of this tumor. SCC may metastasize through lymphatic transmission, blood-&#173;borne transmission, or direct extension, often along nerves (perineural spread). Recurrences should be treated with wide surgical resection, possibly including orbital exenteration or neck dissection, and may require collaboration with a head and neck cancer surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist. Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, specifically PD-1 inhibitors, have become a promising option for patients with advanced, recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic SCC of the head and neck.</p>

				<p class="h3">Sebaceous carcinoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sebaceous carcinoma (also called sebaceous gland carcinoma, sebaceous cell carcinoma, sebaceous adenocarcinoma, or meibomian gland carcinoma) is a highly malignant and potentially lethal tumor that arises from the meibomian glands of the tarsal plate; from the glands of Zeis associated with the eyelashes; or from the sebaceous glands of the caruncle, eyebrow, or facial skin. Unlike basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma occurs more frequently in &#173;women and originates twice as often in the upper eyelid as in the lower, reflecting the greater numbers of meibomian and glands of Zeis in the upper eyelid. Multicentric origin is common, and separate upper and lower eyelid tumors occur in 6%–8% of patients. Patients are commonly older than 50&#160;years, although tumors have been reported in younger patients. It represents approximately 1% of periorbital malignancies in the United States.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;These tumors typically appear yellow due to lipid material within the neoplastic cells and often masquerade as benign eyelid diseases. Clinically, they may simulate chalazia, chronic blepharitis, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, mucous membrane (ocular cicatricial) pemphigoid, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, or pannus associated with adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Typically, effacement of the meibomian gland orifices with destruction of hair follicles occurs, leading to madarosis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-49">Fig&#160;10-49</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">In sebaceous carcinoma, the tumor within the tarsal plate tends to pro&#173;gress in an intraepithelial growth phase, which may extend over the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva. A fine papillary elevation of the tarsal conjunctiva may indicate pagetoid spread of tumor cells; intraepithelial growth may replace corneal epithelium as well. Marked conjunctival inflammation and hyperemia may be pre&#173;sent.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A nodule that initially simulates a chalazion but &#173;later &#173;causes eyelash loss and destruction of the meibomian gland orifices warrants biopsy &#173;because this pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is characteristic of sebaceous carcinoma. Solid material from a chalazion that has been excised more than once should be submitted for histologic examination. &#173;Because histologic misdiagnosis can occur, the clinician should maintain suspicion based on clinical findings and request special stains (lipid) or additional histopathologic consultation if warranted. Any chronic unilateral blepharitis should raise suspicion of sebaceous carcinoma.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mui</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Torre syndrome (MTS)</span> is an impor&#173;tant consideration if a patient is diagnosed with sebaceous carcinoma. MTS is an autosomal dominant condition of sebaceous tumors (including sebaceous carcinoma, sebaceous adenoma, and basal cell epithelioma with sebaceous differentiation) involving the gastrointestinal, endometrial, or urologic systems.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Because eyelid margin sebaceous carcinomas originate in the tarsal plate or the eyelash margin, superficial shave biopsies may reveal chronic inflammation but miss the under&#173;lying tumor. Full-&#173;thickness eyelid biopsy with permanent sections or full-&#173;thickness punch biopsy of the tarsal plate may be required to obtain the correct diagnosis. Characteristic histology findings of pale, foamy cytoplasm are covered in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Wide surgical excision has historically been the standard treatment for sebaceous carcinoma, although Mohs micrographic surgery has been shown to result in lower local recurrence rates for periorbital sebaceous carcinoma. Overall, considerable caution is required &#173;because of pagetoid spread, skip lesions, and the polycentric nature of &#173;these tumors. Map biopsies of the conjunctiva are helpful to assess for pagetoid spread. If pagetoid spread is pre&#173;sent, adjunctive cryotherapy or topical chemotherapy (mitomycin-&#173;C or 5-&#173;fluorouracil) may be used. Orbital exenteration (see <span class="h4-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span> in this volume) may be considered for recurrent or large tumors invading through the orbital septum. &#173;These tumors usually metastasize to regional lymph nodes but may in rare cases spread hematogenously or through direct extension. Radiation therapy is not appropriate as a primary treatment modality, &#173;because sebaceous carcinomas are relatively radioresistant.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Evaluation of the lymph nodes begins with palpation for any lymphadenopathy on physical examination and pos&#173;si&#173;ble diagnostic imaging to evaluate for enlarged or enhancing lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered for patients with eyelid sebaceous cell carcinoma with high-&#173;risk features (recurrent lesions, or extensive involvement of the eyelid [<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>10&#160;mm] or orbit), as well as for conjunctival or cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow thickness greater than 1&#160;mm or Merkel cell carcinoma of the eyelid. Except for basal cell carcinoma, cancers of the eyelid and conjunctiva typically metastasize to the regional lymph nodes, and regional metastasis commonly occurs before metastasis to distant sites. Regional lymphadenectomy includes parotidectomy &#173;because of the lymphatic drainage routes of periorbital structures. Identification of regional nodal metastases may indicate that more extensive therapy is warranted, such as adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, and can provide prognostic information to the physician and patient (<span class="xref-keypoints">Key Points 10-1</span>).</p>

				<p class="h3">Melanoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although melanoma accounts for approximately 1%–2% of cutaneous cancers, it &#173;causes approximately 75% of deaths due to skin cancer. The incidence of melanoma in the United States has been steadily increasing during the past 30&#160;years. Risk &#173;factors include sunlight exposure, tanning beds, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition, and environmental mutagens. Cutaneous melanomas may develop de novo or from preexisting melanocytic nevi or lentigo maligna. Primary cutaneous melanoma of the eyelid skin is rare (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>0.1% of eyelid malignancies). Melanoma should be suspected in any patient older than 20&#160;years with an acquired pigmented lesion. Melanomas typically have variable pigmentation and irregular borders and may ulcerate and bleed.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 4 clinicopathologic forms of cutaneous melanoma:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">lentigo maligna melanoma</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">nodular melanoma</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">superficial spreading melanoma</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">acrolentiginous melanoma</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">The eyelid is most often involved by &#173;either lentigo maligna melanoma or nodular melanoma. <span class="italic">Lentigo maligna melanoma</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-50">Fig&#160;10-50</span>) represents the invasive vertical malignant growth phase that occurs in 2.0%–2.6% of patients with lentigo maligna. It accounts for 90% of head and neck melanomas. Clinically, the invasive areas are marked by nodule formation within the broader, flat, tan to brown irregular macule. The eyelid is usually involved by secondary extension from the malar region, and pigmentation may pro&#173;gress over the eyelid margin onto the conjunctival surface. Excision is recommended for a premalignant lentigo maligna and is mandatory in patients with lentigo maligna melanoma. Unlike the other types of melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma has a higher incidence of <span class="italic">p53</span> alterations compared with <span class="italic">BRAF</span> alterations. <span class="italic">Nodular melanoma</span> accounts for approximately 10% of cutaneous melanomas but is extremely rare on the eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-51">Fig&#160;10-51</span>). &#173;These tumors may be amelanotic. The vertical invasive growth phase is the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of &#173;these lesions; thus, they are likely to have extended deeply by the time of diagnosis.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Treatment of cutaneous melanoma includes wide surgical excision with histologic confirmation (using permanent sections) of complete tumor removal. Randomized &#173;trials have thus far provided insufficient information to determine optimal excision margins for primary cutaneous eyelid melanoma. In the periocular regions, margins less than 1&#160;cm are often used to help preserve tissue needed for reconstruction and protection of the eye.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Regional lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed for melanomas that have microscopic evidence of vascular or lymphatic involvement or Bres&#173;low thickness greater than 1&#160;mm. Complete preoperative metastatic workup is indicated for tumors with thickness greater than 1.5&#160;mm. Thin lesions (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>0.75&#160;mm) confer a 5-&#173;year survival rate of 98%, whereas thicker lesions (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>4&#160;mm) with ulceration have a survival rate of less than 50%. &#173;Because tumor thickness has strong prognostic implications, a punch biopsy that allows a core to be taken through the full tumor depth should be performed. Biopsy of &#173;these lesions does not increase the risk of metastatic spread.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Although cryotherapy may have a role in the treatment of acquired melanomas in the conjunctiva, it should not be considered for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma. Topical imiquimod cream can be considered in some cases of very early melanomas that are located in sensitive areas of the face where surgery may be disfiguring.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Immunotherapy</span> can help stimulate the immune system or enhance the ability of immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. &#173;Because this modality can also affect healthy cells, side effects such as flulike symptoms, fatigue, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal prob&#173;lems may occur. Immunotherapy drugs can be used as a first-&#173;line treatment for melanoma or in combination with chemotherapy or surgery.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cytokines,</span> such as interleukin-2 and peginterferon alfa-2b, are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-&#173;approved adjuvant therapies for metastatic melanoma that has been surgically resected but has a high risk of recurrence. &#173;These agents help stimulate the rapid growth and activity of immune cells. However, recent randomized &#173;trials of interferon used in an adjuvant setting show that it can lengthen the time to melanoma recurrence but does not appear to prolong survival. &#173;These drugs may also be given in conjunction with chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Checkpoint inhibitors</span> block signaling proteins that would other&#173;wise prevent activated <span class="Hyperlink">T cells</span> from attacking the tumor, thus allowing the immune system to induce tumor regression in cases of advanced or metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab, which stimulates T cells, was the first drug of this type to be approved. It was followed by pembrolizumab and nivolumab, which target PD-1, a protein on T cells that normally helps keep T cells from attacking other cells in the body. By blocking PD-1, &#173;these drugs boost the immune response against melanoma cells, causing tumor regression. Nivolumab has been approved as a single agent for first-&#173;line therapy in inoperable or metastatic melanoma, or as a second-&#173;line treatment &#173;after treatment with ipilimumab. Some &#173;trials showed nivolumab improved survival in treated patients when compared with chemotherapy. Combination therapy using nivolumab and ipilimumab has demonstrated improved responses; however, the risk of adverse effects, such as elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal toxicities, and severe pneumonitis, increases. Nivolumab has recently received accelerated approval as a single agent in the treatment of melanoma with a <span class="italic">BRAF</span> V600 alteration.</p>

Conjunctival lesions can be mistaken for a foreign-&#173;body granuloma or cavernous hemangioma. The lesion is composed of spindle cells of probable endothelial origin. It may be treated with cryotherapy, excision, radiation, or intralesional chemotherapeutic agents. If Kaposi sarcoma is related to AIDS, it may regress with adequate antiviral treatment of the under&#173;lying HIV infection.</p>
				<p class="h3">Merkel cell carcinoma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Merkel cell is part of the dendritic (neuroendocrine) cell population of the skin and plays a role in mediating the sense of touch. Merkel cells can give rise to malignant neoplasms, 10% of which occur in the eyelid and periocular area and manifest as painless, erythematous nodules with overlying telangiectasias (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-53">Fig&#160;10-53</span>). Merkel cell carcinoma can mimic other malignant lesions, making diagnosis difficult. One-&#173;third of the tumors recur &#173;after excision, and &#173;there is a high rate of metastasis. The estimated 5-&#173;year survival rate is 50%. Initial treatment should include aggressive wide surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation and/or chemotherapy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered in guiding prognosis and adjuvant treatment.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Immunotherapy has become an impor&#173;tant new therapy in treating advanced and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, and avelumab, which blocks the PD-1 ligand, are both FDA approved to treat Merkel cell carcinoma and show more durable response rates compared with chemotherapy.</p>
