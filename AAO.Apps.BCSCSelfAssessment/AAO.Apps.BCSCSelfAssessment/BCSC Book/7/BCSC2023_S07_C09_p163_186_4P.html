			<p class="h1">Face</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The structural planes of the face include skin, subcutaneous tissue, the <span class="italic">superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS),</span> mimetic muscles, the deep facial fascia, retaining ligaments, and the plane containing the facial nerve, parotid duct, and buccal fat pad.</p>
				<p class="h2">Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System and Temporoparietal Fascia</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The superficial facial fascia, which is an extension of the superficial cervical fascia in the neck, invests the facial mimetic muscles to create the SMAS (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-1">Fig&#160;9-1A, B</span>). The SMAS distributes facial muscle contractions, facilitating facial expression. &#173;These muscle actions are transmitted to the skin by ligamentous attachments located between the SMAS and the dermis. The SMAS is also connected to the under&#173;lying bone by a network of fibrous septa and ligaments. Thus, facial support is transmitted from the deep fixed structures of the face to the overlying dermis. &#173;There are 2 major components of this system:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">osteocutaneous ligaments (orbitomalar, zygomatic, and mandibular), which are thick fibrous attachments that originate from the bony periosteum</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">fascial cutaneous ligaments (parotidocutaneous and masseteric), which are formed by a condensation of superficial and deep facial fasciae</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">As &#173;these ligaments become attenuated in conjunction with facial dermal elastosis, facial aging becomes apparent. Dissection and repositioning of the SMAS have impor&#173;tant implications for facial cosmetic surgery.</p>
				<p class="body-text">As the SMAS continues superiorly over the zygomatic arch, it becomes continuous with the <span class="italic">temporoparietal fascia</span> (also called the <span class="italic">superficial temporal fascia</span>). More superiorly, the SMAS becomes continuous with the galea aponeurotica. Beneath the loose areolar tissue and the temporoparietal fascia, the deep temporal fascia of the temporal muscle splits and envelops the temporal fat pad, creating deep and superficial layers of the deep temporal fascia (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-1">Fig&#160;9-1C</span>).</p>
				<p class="h2">Mimetic Muscles</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mimetic muscles (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-2">Fig&#160;9-2</span>) can be grouped into upper and lower face muscles.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The upper face muscles include</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">corrugator supercilii (oblique and transverse heads) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-3">Fig&#160;9-3</span>), depressor supercilii, and procerus muscles that animate the glabella and medial eyebrow and cause vertical and oblique rhytids</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">the orbicularis oculi muscle, which depresses the eyebrows and enables eyelid protraction (ie, closure)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">the frontalis, which is the sole elevator of the eyebrows; contraction of this muscle &#173;causes transverse forehead rhytids</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">The lower face muscles include</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">superficial mimetic muscles, which receive their neurovascular supply on the posterior surfaces and include the platysma, zygomaticus major, zygomaticus minor, and risorius</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">deep mimetic muscles, which receive their neurovascular supply anteriorly and include the buccinator, mentalis, and levator anguli oris</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Other facial muscles include the orbicularis oris, levator labii superioris, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, depressor anguli oris, depressor labii inferioris, masseter, nasalis, and temporalis.</p>
				<p class="h2">Facial Nerve</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the neck, the superficial cervical fascia and platysma are continuous with the SMAS, and the deep cervical fascia is found on the superficial surface of the strap muscles, superior to the hyoid bone. The deep cervical fascia overlies the mylohyoid muscle and extends superiorly over the body of the mandible, continuing as the parotideomasseteric fascia. The facial nerve lies deep to this thin layer in the lower face. Above the zygomatic arch in the temporal region, the parotideomasseteric fascia is continuous with the deep temporal fascia, and the temporal (frontal) branch of the facial nerve lies superficial to this fascial layer. The transition of the temporal branch of the facial nerve from deep to superficial occurs as the nerve crosses over the zygomatic arch. When biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is performed, care is taken to avoid injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve that passes just inferior to the artery, both of which lie in the temporoparietal fascial plane (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-4">Fig&#160;9-4</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The facial nerve, cranial nerve (CN) VII, innervates the mimetic muscles and divides into 5 major branches within or deep to the parotid gland (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-5">Fig&#160;9-5</span>): temporal (frontal), zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical. Two surgical planes help surgeons avoid CN VII when they operate: dissection on top of the deep temporal fascia (see Fig&#160;9-4), which is deep to the SMAS and deep to CN VII, in the upper face and temporal region; and dissection superficial to the SMAS and CN VII branches in the lower face.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In the temporal area, the temporal branch of CN VII (see Fig&#160;9-5) crosses the zygomatic arch and courses superomedially in the deep layers of the temporoparietal fascia. The temporoparietal fascia is continuous with the SMAS of the lower face and the galea aponeurosis of the upper face. Deep to the temporoparietal fascia is the previously mentioned <span class="italic">deep temporal fascia</span>, a dense, immobile fascia that overlies the temporalis muscle and is continuous with the frontal periosteum (see Fig&#160;9-1C). Dissection along this fascia allows mobilization of the temporal forehead while avoiding the overlying temporal branch of the facial nerve. This anatomic princi&#173;ple is impor&#173;tant when surgeons perform brow-&#173;lifting and forehead-&#173;lifting procedures. The safety zone is within 2&#160;cm (on average) from the lateral canthus to avoid the frontal branch of the facial nerve as it crosses over the zygomatic arch (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-6">Fig&#160;9-6</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">In the lower face, the facial nerve branches, sensory nerves, vascular networks, and parotid gland and duct are deep to the SMAS (see Figs&#160;9-1A, 9-5). Dissection just superficial to the SMAS, parotid gland, and parotideomasseteric fascia in the lower face avoids injury to &#173;these structures. The face receives sensory innervation from the 3 branches of CN V: V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span>, ophthalmic; V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>, maxillary; and V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">3</span>, mandibular (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-7">Fig&#160;9-7</span>). Damage to &#173;these nerves &#173;causes facial numbness and paresthesia. Fortunately, overlap of the distal branches makes permanent sensation loss unusual, &#173;unless injury occurs at the proximal neurovascular bundles or with extensive distal disruption, as can be seen with a coronal incision.</p>
				<p class="h2">Arterial Network</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An understanding of the vascular supply of the eyelids and face is crucial during facial surgery, as well as when nonsurgical facial procedures, such as soft-&#173;tissue filler augmentation and neurotoxin chemodenervation, are performed. Although very rare (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>0.001%–0.5% of nonsurgical facial procedures), skin necrosis can result from direct injection into a facial artery; this has been reported for &#173;every filler type. The risk is highest for procedures performed in the glabella, due to its &#173;limited collateral circulation; the supraorbital, supratrochlear, infraorbital, and angular arteries are the most vulnerable overall (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-8">Fig&#160;9-8A</span>). Early signs of arterial vascular compromise are pain and skin pallor; signs of venous occlusion often have a delayed onset, presenting as dull pain and skin discoloration.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The most devastating adverse outcome associated with soft-&#173;tissue fillers is blindness that results from occlusion of the ophthalmic artery or its branches. An intravascular bolus of filler can reach the ophthalmic artery via retrograde flow from any number of facial arteries, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, the dorsal nasal, angular, supratrochlear, or supraorbital vessels (<span class="xref-activity">Activity 9-1</span>; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-8">Fig&#160;9-8B, C</span>). Vision loss is often profound (no light perception) and permanent. Dissemination of filler in a facial artery can also result in focal brain infarctions, leading to hemiplegia and dysarthria. In rare instances, vascular occlusions in the periorbital area can also result in ophthalmoplegia and ptosis.</p>

				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Skin and Subcutaneous Connective Tissue</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid skin is the thinnest skin of the body and is unique in having no subcutaneous fat layer. &#173;Because the thin skin of the eyelids is subjected to constant movement (blinking), the laxity that often occurs with age is not surprising. In both the upper and the lower eyelids, the pretarsal tissues are normally firmly attached to the under&#173;lying tissues, whereas the preseptal tissues are more loosely attached, creating potential spaces for fluid accumulation. The contours of the eyelid skin are defined by the <span class="italic">eyelid crease</span> and the <span class="italic">eyelid fold:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">The upper eyelid crease represents the attachments of the levator aponeurosis to the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and skin. In the eyelids of most &#173;people not of East Asian descent, this site is near or at the level of the superior tarsal border.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">The upper eyelid fold consists of the loose preseptal skin and subcutaneous tissues that rest above the confluence of the levator aponeurosis and orbital septum.

				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Racial variation can be seen in the location of the eyelid crease and eyelid fold (Fig&#160;9-10A). The eyelid of an individual of East Asian descent usually has a relatively low upper eyelid crease &#173;because the orbital septum fuses with the levator aponeurosis between the eyelid margin and the superior border of tarsus, in contrast to an eyelid in which the fusion is supratarsal (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-10">Fig&#160;9-10B</span>). This also allows preaponeurotic fat to occupy a position more inferior and anterior in the East Asian eyelid. Although the lower eyelid crease is less well defined than the upper eyelid crease, &#173;these differences are apparent in the lower eyelid as well.</p>
				<p class="h2">Muscles of Protraction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbicularis oculi muscle is the main protractor of the eyelid. Innervated by CN VII, contraction of this muscle narrows the palpebral fissure. Specific portions of this muscle also constitute the lacrimal pump. The orbicularis oculi muscle is divided into <span class="italic">pretarsal, preseptal,</span> and <span class="italic">orbital</span> parts (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-11">Fig&#160;9-11</span>; see also Fig&#160;9-6). The palpebral (pretarsal and preseptal) parts are integral to involuntary eyelid movements (blinking), whereas the orbital portion is primarily involved in forced eyelid closure.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The pretarsal orbicularis muscle arises from deep origins at the posterior lacrimal crest and superficial origins at the anterior limb of the medial canthal tendon. Near the common canaliculus, the deep heads of the pretarsal orbicularis fuse to form a prominent bundle of fibers known as the <span class="italic">Horner muscle,</span> which continues just &#173;behind the posterior limb of the medial canthal tendon to insert onto the posterior lacrimal crest. The upper and lower eyelid segments of the pretarsal orbicularis fuse in the lateral canthal area to become the lateral canthal tendon (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-12">Fig&#160;9-12</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The preseptal orbicularis arises from the upper and lower borders of the medial canthal tendon, as a single head from the medial canthal tendon. In the upper eyelid, the preseptal muscle has an anterior head from the medial canthal tendon and a posterior head from both the superior and posterior limbs of the tendon. Laterally, the preseptal muscles form the lateral palpebral raphe.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The orbital portions of the orbicularis muscle arise from the anterior limb of the medial canthal tendon, the orbital pro&#173;cess of the frontal bone, and the frontal pro&#173;cess of the maxillary bone in front of the anterior lacrimal crest. Its fibers form a continuous ellipse and insert just below the point of origin. At the eyelid margin, a specialized bundle of striated muscle fibers, the <span class="italic">muscle of Riolan,</span> lies more posterior than the main portion of the orbicularis and creates the gray line (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-13">Fig&#160;9-13</span>). The muscle of Riolan may play a role in meibomian glandular discharge, blinking, and eyelash position.</p>
				<p class="h2">Orbital Septum</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbital septum, a thin, multilayered sheet of fibrous tissue, arises from the periosteum over the superior and inferior orbital rims at the arcus marginalis. In the upper eyelid, the orbital septum typically fuses with the levator aponeurosis 2–5&#160;mm above the superior tarsal border, and below the superior tarsus in the eyelids of &#173;people of East Asian descent (see Figs&#160;9-9 and 9-10). In the lower eyelid, the orbital septum fuses with the capsulopalpebral fascia at or just below the inferior tarsal border. Along with a small contribution from the inferior tarsal smooth muscle, the fused capsulopalpebral–&#173;orbital septum complex inserts on the posterior and anterior tarsal surfaces as well as the inferior border of the tarsus. Over time, thinning and attenuation of the septum and increased laxity of the orbicularis muscle contribute to anterior herniation of the orbital fat pads.</p>
				<p class="h2">Orbital Fat</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital fat lies posterior to the orbital septum and anterior to the levator aponeurosis (upper eyelid) and the capsulopalpebral fascia (lower eyelid). In the upper eyelid, &#173;there are 2 fat pads: medial and central (preaponeurotic). In the lower eyelid, &#173;there are 3 fat pads: medial, central, and lateral (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-14">Fig&#160;9-14</span>). The inferior oblique muscle runs between the medial and central fat pads (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-15">Fig&#160;9-15</span>). &#173;These pockets are surrounded by thin fibrous capsules that are continuations of the anterior orbitoseptal system. The central orbital fat pad of the upper eyelid is an impor&#173;tant landmark in both elective eyelid surgery and eyelid laceration repair &#173;because it lies directly &#173;behind the orbital septum and in front of the levator aponeurosis.</p>
				<p class="h2">Muscles of Retraction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The upper eyelid retractors are the levator palpebrae superioris muscle with its aponeurosis and the superior tarsal muscle <span class="italic">(M</span><span class="accent_italic">ü</span><span class="italic">ller muscle).</span> In the lower eyelid, the retractors are the capsulopalpebral fascia and the inferior tarsal muscle.</p>
				<p class="h3">Upper eyelid retractors</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The levator muscle originates in the apex of the orbit, arising from the periorbita of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, just above the annulus of Zinn. The muscular portion of the levator is approximately 40&#160;mm long; the aponeurosis is 14–20&#160;mm in length (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-16">Fig&#160;9-16</span>). The superior transverse ligament <span class="italic">(Whitnall ligament)</span> is a sleeve of elastic fibers around the levator muscle. It is located near or above the area where the levator muscle transitions into the levator aponeurosis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-17">Figs&#160;9-17</span>, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-18">9-18</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The Whitnall ligament functions primarily as a suspensory support for the upper eyelid and the superior orbital tissues. The ligament also acts as a fulcrum for the levator, transferring its vector force from an anterior–&#173;posterior to a superior–&#173;inferior direction. Its analogue in the lower eyelid is the <span class="italic">Lockwood ligament.</span> Medially, the Whitnall ligament attaches to connective tissue around the trochlea and superior oblique tendon. Laterally, it forms septa through the lacrimal gland stroma, then arches upward to attach inside the lateral orbital wall several millimeters above the lateral orbital tubercle via attachments to the lacrimal gland fascia, with a small group of fibers extending inferiorly to insert onto the lateral ret&#173;i&#173;naculum. The Whitnall ligament should not be confused with the horns of the levator aponeurosis, which lie more inferior and &#173;toward the canthi (see Fig&#160;9-17). The lateral horn inserts onto the lateral orbital tubercle; the medial horn inserts onto the posterior lacrimal crest. The lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis is robust and divides the lacrimal gland into the orbital and palpebral lobes; it attaches firmly to the orbital tubercle. The medial horn of the aponeurosis is more delicate and forms loose connective attachments to the posterior aspect of the medial canthal tendon and posterior lacrimal crest.</p>
				<p class="body-text">As the levator aponeurosis continues &#173;toward the tarsus, it divides into an anterior portion and a posterior portion a variable distance above the superior tarsal border. The anterior portion is composed of fine strands of aponeurosis that insert into the septa between the pretarsal orbicularis muscle bundles and skin. &#173;These fine attachments are responsible for the close apposition of the pretarsal skin and orbicularis muscle to the under&#173;lying tarsus. The upper eyelid crease is formed by the most superior of &#173;these attachments and by contraction of the under&#173;lying levator complex (see Fig&#160;9-9). The upper eyelid fold is created by the overhanging skin, fat, and orbicularis muscle superior to the crease.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The posterior portion of the levator aponeurosis inserts firmly onto the anterior surface of the superior two-&#173;thirds of the tarsus. It is most firmly attached approximately 3&#160;mm above the eyelid margin and is only loosely attached to the superior 2–3&#160;mm of tarsus. Disinsertion, dehiscence, or rarefaction of the aponeurosis following ocular surgery or due to intraocular inflammation, eyelid trauma, or senescence may give rise to ptosis. The levator muscle is innervated by the superior division of CN III, which also supplies the superior rectus muscle. A superior division palsy, which usually results in ptosis and decreased upgaze, implies a distal disruption of CN III.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The&#160;M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle originates from the undersurface of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle approximately at the level of the Whitnall ligament, 12–14&#160;mm above the upper tarsal border (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-19">Fig&#160;9-19</span>). The levator muscle divides into an anterior branch, which becomes the aponeurosis, and a posterior branch, which becomes the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle. This sympathetically innervated smooth muscle extends inferiorly to insert along the superior tarsal border. The muscle provides approximately 2–3&#160;mm of elevation of the upper eyelid; if it is interrupted (as in Horner syndrome), mild ptosis results. The&#160;M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle is firmly attached to the conjunctiva posteriorly, especially just above the superior tarsal border. The peripheral arterial arcade is found between the levator aponeurosis and the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle, just above the superior tarsal border (see Fig&#160;9-19). This vascular arcade serves as a useful surgical landmark to identify the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle.</p>
				<p class="h3">Lower eyelid retractors</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The capsulopalpebral fascia in the lower eyelid is analogous to the levator aponeurosis in the upper eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-20">Fig&#160;9-20</span>; see also Figs&#160;9-9, 9-17). The fascia originates as the capsulopalpebral head from attachments to the terminal muscle fibers of the inferior rectus muscle. The capsulopalpebral head divides as it encircles the inferior oblique muscle and fuses with the sheath of the inferior oblique muscle. Anterior to the inferior oblique muscle, the 2 portions of the capsulopalpebral head join to form the Lockwood suspensory ligament. The capsulopalpebral fascia extends anteriorly from this point, sending strands to the inferior conjunctival fornix, to the inferior tarsal border &#173;after fusing with the orbital septum, and to the skin to create the eyelid crease.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The inferior tarsal muscle in the lower eyelid is analogous to the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle, although it is less well developed structurally. It runs posterior to the capsulopalpebral fascia, with smooth muscle fibers most abundant in the area of the inferior fornix.</p>
				<p class="h2">Tarsus</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The tarsi are firm, dense plates of connective tissue that serve as the structural support for the eyelids (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-21">Fig&#160;9-21</span>). The upper eyelid tarsal plate mea&#173;sures 10–12&#160;mm vertically at the central eyelid in &#173;people not of East Asian descent but is roughly 2&#160;mm shorter in the eyelids of individuals of East Asian descent; the lower eyelid tarsal plate mea&#173;sures 4&#160;mm. The tarsal plates are typically 1&#160;mm thick and taper at the ends to form rigid attachments to the periosteum through the medial and lateral canthal tendons. They may become horizontally displaced with age as a result of stretching of the medial and lateral supporting tendons. The meibomian glands within the tarsus are modified holocrine sebaceous glands.</p>
				<p class="h2">Conjunctiva</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The palpebral conjunctiva is composed of nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. It forms the posterior layer of the eyelids and contains the mucin-&#173;secreting goblet cells and the accessory lacrimal <span class="italic">glands of Wolfring</span> and <span class="italic">Krause</span> (see Fig&#160;9-9)<span class="italic">.</span> The accessory lacrimal glands are found in the subconjunctival tissue mainly in the upper and lower eyelids. The glands of Wolfring are found primarily along the nonmarginal tarsal borders, and the glands of Krause are found in the fornices.</p>
				<p class="h2">Additional Anatomical Considerations</p>
				<p class="h3-h2 ParaOverride-7">Connective tissue</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Suborbicularis fat pads</span> Deep to the orbicularis muscle, overlying the maxillary and zygomatic periosteum, is a plane of nonseptate fat called the <span class="h4-text_italic">suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF).</span> This fat is analogous to the superiorly located <span class="h4-text_italic">retro-&#173;orbicularis oculi fat (ROOF),</span> which is situated deep to the eyebrow and extends into the eyelid, where it merges with postorbicularis fascia in the upper eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-22">Fig&#160;9-22</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The medial and lateral SOOF are deep fat pads of the cheek, located below the inferior orbital rim, and play an impor&#173;tant role in the gradual gravitational descent of the midfacial soft tissues that occurs with age. Repositioning of the SOOF can support involutional, cicatricial, and paralytic ectropion of the lower eyelid. In aesthetic procedures, elevation of the SOOF restores more youthful contours in the lower eyelid and midfacial soft tissues.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The ROOF is the brow fat pad located deep above the superior orbital rim. It also undergoes gravitational descent, compounding redundant dermatochalasis and fullness. The descended ROOF, which is whiter and more fibrous, should not be confused with prominent prolapsed yellow preaponeurotic fat in the upper eyelid. In some patients, it is necessary to reposition the descended ROOF to the frontal periosteum during blepharoplasty to achieve an adequate functional and aesthetic result. The ROOF and SOOF can also become enlarged in patients with thyroid eye disease.</p>
				<p class="h2">Canthal Tendons</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The configuration of the palpebral fissure is maintained by the medial and lateral canthal tendons in conjunction with the attached tarsal plates (see Fig&#160;9-21). The 2 origins of the medial canthal tendon from the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests fuse just temporal to the lacrimal sac; they then split again into an upper limb and a lower limb that attach to the upper superior and lower inferior tarsal plates. The attachment of the tendon to the periosteum overlying the anterior lacrimal crest is diffuse and strong. The attachment to the posterior lacrimal crest is more delicate but is impor&#173;tant in maintaining apposition of the eyelids to the globe, which allows the puncta to lie in the tear lake.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Stretching or disinsertion of the medial canthal tendon may cause cosmetic or functional prob&#173;lems such as telecanthus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-23">Fig&#160;9-23</span>). Trauma to the medial canthus can result in canaliculus-&#173;involving lacerations and medial canthal avulsion with poor apposition. Severe trauma can result in naso-&#173;orbital-&#173;ethmoidal (NOE) fractures with varying degrees of damage to the lacrimal and ethmoid bones as well as to the medial canthal tendon, which can lead to medial canthal dystopia, epistaxis, and lacrimal damage (see Chapter&#160;6).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The lateral canthal tendon attaches at the lateral orbital tubercle 2–5&#160;mm inside the lateral orbital rim. It splits into superior and inferior limbs that attach to the respective tarsal plates. Horizontal eyelid instability is frequently the result of lateral canthal tendon lengthening, which can cause tearing and ectropion (see Chapter 14, Fig 14-4, for an illustration of the lacrimal pump mechanism). The lateral canthal tendon usually inserts 2&#160;mm higher than the medial canthal tendon, giving the horizontal palpebral fissure a natu&#173;ral upward slope from medial to lateral. Insertion of the lateral canthal tendon inferior to the medial canthal tendon &#173;causes the horizontal palpebral fissure to slant downward.</p>
				<p class="h3">Eyelid margin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eyelid margin is the confluence of the mucosal surface of the conjunctiva, the edge of the orbicularis, and the cutaneous epithelium. Along the margin are eyelashes and glands, which provide protection for the ocular surface. The <span class="italic">gray line</span> is an isolated section of pretarsal orbicularis muscle (Riolan muscle) just anterior to the tarsus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-24">Fig&#160;9-24</span>; also see Fig&#160;9-13). The mucocutaneous junction is located posterior to the meibomian gland orifices on the eyelid margin. The horizontal palpebral fissure is approximately 30&#160;mm long. The main portion of the margin, called the <span class="italic">ciliary margin,</span> has rather well-&#173;defined anterior and posterior edges. Medial to the punctum and in the lateral quarter of the eyelid the eyelid margin is thinner.</p>
				<p class="h3">Eyelashes</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are approximately 100 eyelashes, or cilia, on the upper eyelid and 50 on the lower eyelid. The eyelashes originate in the anterior lamella of the eyelid margin, just anterior to the tarsal plate, and form 2 or 3 irregular rows. A few cilia may be found in the caruncle.</p>
				<p class="h3">Meibomian glands</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The meibomian glands are sebaceous glands that contribute to the lipid layer of the tear film via modified holocrine secretion. They originate in the tarsus and number approximately 30–40&#160;in the upper eyelid and 20&#160;in the lower eyelid. During the second month of gestation, both the eyelashes and meibomian glands differentiate from a common pilosebaceous unit. This dual potentiality explains why, following trauma or chronic irritation, an eyelash follicle may develop from a meibomian gland <span class="italic">(acquired distichiasis).</span> Similarly, an extra row of eyelashes arising from the meibomian orifices may be pre&#173;sent from birth <span class="italic">(congenital distichiasis).</span></p>
				<p class="h3">Vascular and lymphatic supply</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The extensive vascularity of the eyelids promotes healing and helps defend against infection. The arterial supply of the eyelids comes from 2 main sources: (1) the internal carotid artery by way of the ophthalmic artery and its branches (supraorbital and lacrimal) and (2) the external carotid artery by way of the arteries of the face (angular and temporal). Collateral circulation between &#173;these 2 systems is extensive, anastomosing throughout the upper and lower eyelids and forming the marginal and peripheral arcades (see Fig&#160;9-9).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">marginal arterial arcade</span> should not be confused with the peripheral arterial arcade. In the upper eyelid, the marginal arcade lies 2&#160;mm superior to the margin, near the follicles of the cilia and anterior to the tarsal plate. The <span class="italic">peripheral arcade</span> lies superior to the tarsus, between the levator aponeurosis and the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle (see Figs&#160;9-9, 9-19). The lower eyelid often has only 1 arterial arcade, located at the inferior tarsal border.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Eyelid venous drainage may be divided into a <span class="italic">preseptal</span> system, in which the preseptal tissues drain into the angular vein medially and into the superficial temporal vein laterally, and a <span class="italic">postseptal</span> system, in which drainage flows into the orbital veins and the deeper branches of the anterior facial vein and pterygoid plexus (see Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). Lymphatic vessels serving the medial portion of the eyelids typically drain into the submandibular lymph nodes. Lymphatic channels serving the lateral eyelids drain first into the superficial preauricular nodes and then into the deeper cervical nodes (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 9-25">Fig&#160;9-25</span>). This has implications for eyelid malignancies and potential metastatic spread.</p>
