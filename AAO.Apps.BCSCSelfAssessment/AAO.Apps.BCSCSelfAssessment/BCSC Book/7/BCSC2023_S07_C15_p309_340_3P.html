				<p class="h2-h1">Lacrimal Secretory System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital abnormalities of the lacrimal gland are rare. Hypoplasia and agenesis of the lacrimal gland can occur in isolation or in conjunction with congenital abnormalities of the salivary glands. Ec&#173;topic lacrimal gland tissue can be pre&#173;sent within the orbit and eyelids. Seldomly, an aberrant lacrimal ductule (previously known as a <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">lacrimal gland fistula</span>) may exit externally through the central or lateral upper eyelid with an associated cluster of eyelashlike hairs or may exit through an orifice at the lateral canthus<span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">.</span> Tears that egress through an aberrant ductule can mimic epiphora and can be successfully managed with &#173;simple excision of the tract.</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="h3">Duplication</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple puncta and additional canaliculi typically occur on the eyelid margin and are often asymptomatic and require no treatment (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-1">Fig&#160;15-1</span>). Lacrimal–&#173;cutaneous fistula is an uncommon tract that exits through the skin, typically infranasal to the medial canthus (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-2">Fig&#160;15-2</span>). This type of fistula is sometimes asymptomatic but may be associated with tears that appear on the skin. Approximately one-&#173;third of patients with lacrimal–&#173;cutaneous fistula also have an under&#173;lying NLDO; in &#173;these cases, chronic mucoid discharge from the affected nasolacrimal sac may be pre&#173;sent.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In symptomatic patients, direct surgical excision of the epithelium-&#173;lined fistulous tract with primary suture closure is indicated. In patients with under&#173;lying NLDO and chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal intubation or dacryocystorhinostomy may also be required. (See the subsection “Management” in the section&#160;Acquired Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction &#173;later in this chapter.)</p>
				<p class="h3">Aplasia and hypoplasia</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Punctal hypoplasia and stenosis are encountered more frequently than true punctal aplasia (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-3">Fig&#160;15-3</span>). Management of punctal stenosis, membranes, and aplasia is discussed &#173;later in this chapter.</p>
				<p class="h3">Nasolacrimal duct obstruction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital NLDO is typically due to failure of the duct to fully canalize but can be associated with more severe abnormalities. For example, major facial cleft deformities can pass through or occur adjacent to the nasolacrimal drainage pathways and can result in outflow disorders (see Chapter 3, Fig&#160;3-3).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Treatment of lacrimal drainage obstruction differs according to the cause and location of the obstruction. Obstruction may involve the puncta, canaliculi, lacrimal sac, or nasolacrimal duct (NLD). &#173;Because the pathophysiology and management of congenital and acquired lacrimal drainage abnormalities differ, &#173;these disorders are addressed separately.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Congenital Lacrimal Drainage Obstruction</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
				<p class="h2-h1">Evaluation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The evaluation of a patient with congenital tearing is typically straightforward. The patient’s parent or guardian reports a history of tearing, mucopurulent discharge, or both, beginning shortly &#173;after birth. In rare cases, vis&#173;i&#173;ble distention of the lacrimal sac is pre&#173;sent, suggesting a congenital dacryocystocele. Other&#173;wise, distinction should be made among the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">constant tearing with minimal mucopurulence, suggesting blockage of the upper system (puncta, canaliculi, and common canaliculus) caused by punctal or canalicular dysgenesis</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">constant tearing with frequent mucopurulence and mattering of the eyelashes, suggesting complete obstruction of the NLD</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">intermittent tearing with mucopurulence, suggesting intermittent obstruction of the NLD</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text ParaOverride-2">Office examination includes inspection of the eyelid margins for proper apposition and patent puncta and evaluation for extrinsic &#173;causes of reflex hypersecretion, such as</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">ocular surface irritation</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">infectious conjunctivitis</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">entropion</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">epiblepharon</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">trichiasis</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">congenital glaucoma</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Additional aspects of the examination include inspection of the medial canthal region to assess for a distended lacrimal sac (below the tendon), inflammation, or congenital defects such as an encephalocele (above the tendon). The single most impor&#173;tant maneuver is application of digital pressure over the tear sac. If mucoid reflux is pre&#173;sent, complete obstruction at the level of the NLD becomes the working diagnosis.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Punctal and Canalicular Agenesis and Dysgenesis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The medial eyelid margin is inspected for the presence of elevated lacrimal papillae and puncta. Close inspection may reveal a punctum with a membranous occlusion, which can usually be opened with a sharp probe. Temporary intubation may help prevent recurrence. If the punctum is truly absent, the surgeon may cut downward, through the eyelid margin, medial to the expected punctum location to try to identify the canaliculus. Occasionally, &#173;these maneuvers reveal a relatively mature canalicular system with a patent nasolacrimal sac and duct, in which case intubation may be performed. Symptomatic patients with complete absence of the puncta and the canalicular system require a conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR). This is performed when the patient is old enough to allow proper care of the glass (Jones) tube. (CDCR is discussed in the section&#160;Canalicular Obstruction &#173;later in this chapter.)</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system is usually caused by a membrane blocking the valve of Hasner at the nasal end of the NLD. Many newborns are born with imperforate NLDs, but most obstructions open spontaneously within the first few months of life. Such an obstruction becomes clinically evident in only 2%–6% of full-&#173;term infants at 3–4 weeks of age. Of &#173;these, one-&#173;third have bilateral involvement.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Management can be divided into nonsurgical and surgical options. &#173;Because approximately 90% of all symptomatic congenital NLDOs resolve in the first year of life, conservative options such as observation, digital compression over the lacrimal sac, and topical or even oral antibiotics, when necessary, are the initial recommendations. (See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="body-text_italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for information on management.)</p>
				<p class="body-text">When the obstruction fails to resolve with conservative mea&#173;sures, more invasive intervention may be required. Most often, this consists of probing of the NLD to rupture the membrane occluding the duct at the valve of Hasner (discussed in detail &#173;later in this chapter); most surgeons perform probing if symptoms persist at 1 year of age.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Probing can be performed in the office or in the operating room with general anesthesia. The choice is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. The benefits of in-&#173;office probing include avoidance of general anesthesia and cost-&#173;effectiveness, whereas the disadvantages include discomfort of the awake infant. The advantages of surgery &#173;under general anesthesia include a more controlled environment and the ability to acquire more detailed information about the nature of the obstruction.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In some instances of congenital NLDO, dacryocystitis manifests as an acutely inflamed lacrimal sac with cellulitis of the overlying skin. Treatment with systemic antibiotics should be started promptly. Management of the pediatric patient is similar to that of the adult patient (discussed in detail &#173;later in this chapter). &#173;After resolution of the acute infectious pro&#173;cess, elective probing is performed promptly to prevent recurrence of dacryocystitis.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Mohney&#160;BG, Sathiamoorthi&#160;S, Frank&#160;RD. Spontaneous resolution rates in congenital naso&#173;lacrimal duct obstruction managed with massage or topical antibiotics compared with observation alone. <span class="reference--journal--single_italic">Br J&#160;Ophthalmol.</span> 2022;106(9):1196–1199.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Congenital Dacryocystocele</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A congenital dacryocystocele is a cystic dilatation of the lacrimal sac that occurs when &#173;there is a functional block above the sac (at the level of the valve of Rosenm<span class="body-text--no-indent-_accent">ü</span>ller) and an obstruction at the valve of Hasner, resulting in an accumulation of mucus secreted by lacrimal sac goblet cells. It may be pre&#173;sent at birth or develop shortly thereafter and typically appears as a bluish mass below the medial canthus. Distension of the NLD component manifests as an intranasal cyst beneath the inferior turbinate, where it can be observed during nasal examination (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-4">Fig&#160;15-4</span>). Intranasal examination is thus a required component of the evaluation. Airway obstruction is pos&#173;si&#173;ble, especially in the setting of bilateral involvement, as infants are obligate nasal breathers, and may pre&#173;sent as difficulty feeding.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In most patients, dacryocystoceles demonstrate expansion inferior to the medial canthal tendon. Congenital swelling above the medial canthal tendon suggests alternative etiologies, such as a dermoid cyst or meningoencephalocele. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in evaluation of the patient for &#173;these more complex diagnoses.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Singh&#160;S, Ali&#160;MJ. Congenital Dacryocystocele: A&#160;Major Review. <span class="reference--journal--single_italic">Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg.</span> 2019;35(4):309–317.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Probing and irrigation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The procedure begins with topical vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa, usually with application of oxymetazoline hydrochloride. Punctal dilation is often necessary and is facilitated by first coating a size 00 Bowman lacrimal probe with ophthalmic ointment. The probe is initially inserted into the punctum, perpendicular to the eyelid margin, and then turned parallel to the eyelid margin as it is advanced medially along the canalicular system, &#173;toward the medial canthal tendon (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-5">Fig&#160;15-5</span>). Manual lateral traction of the eyelid with the opposite hand straightens the canaliculus, decreasing the risks of damage to the canalicular mucosa and creation of a false passage.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Re&#173;sis&#173;tance to passage of the probe—&#173;along with medial movement of the eyelid soft tissue (“soft stop”), which &#173;causes wrinkling of the overlying skin—&#173;may signify a canalicular obstruction. More commonly, re&#173;sis&#173;tance simply is due to a kink in the canaliculus created by bunching of the soft tissues in front of the probe tip. If kinking is encountered, the probe is withdrawn and reinserted while lateral horizontal traction is maintained (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-6">Fig&#160;15-6</span>). If the probe advances successfully through the common canalicular system and across the lacrimal sac, the medial wall of the lacrimal sac and adjacent lacrimal bone &#173;will be encountered, resulting in a tactile “hard stop.”</p>
				<p class="body-text">The probe is then rotated 90° superiorly &#173;toward the brow &#173;until it lies adjacent to the supraorbital notch. Next, it is directed posteriorly and slightly laterally as it is advanced down the NLD. Creation of a false passage makes it difficult to redirect the probe back into the native lacrimal system. Therefore, if re&#173;sis&#173;tance is encountered and the surgeon is uncertain &#173;whether the probe is in the natu&#173;ral pathway, the probe is repositioned and passage attempted again. At some points of narrowing, particularly at the distal end of the NLD, gentle pressure may be necessary to push through the blockage. The probe tip can be visualized along the lateral wall of the nose &#173;under the inferior turbinate, approximately 2&#160;cm back from the nostril, with an endoscope or a nasal speculum with a fiber-&#173;optic headlight. Alternatively, patency of the duct can be confirmed by metal-&#173;on-&#173;metal contact with another probe inserted through the naris or by irrigation with saline mixed with fluorescein (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-7">Fig&#160;15-7</span>). The fluorescein can be retrieved from the inferior meatus and visualized with a transparent suction catheter. A single lacrimal probing successfully resolves congenital NLDO in 90% of patients who are 13 months or younger.</p>
				<p class="h3">Intubation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intubation with a lacrimal stent is indicated for &#173;children who have recurrent epiphora following nasolacrimal system probing and for older &#173;children in whom initial probing reveals significant stenosis or scarring. Intubation is also useful for the treatment of upper-&#173;system abnormalities such as canalicular stenosis, trauma, and agenesis of the puncta. Nasolacrimal intubation &#173;after failed probing has a reported success rate greater than 70%.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;There are many intubation techniques and types of intubation sets. <span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-8">Figure&#160;15-8</span> illustrates one of the more commonly used stents (ie, the Crawford stent). Keys to successful intubation include shrinkage of the nasal mucosa with a topical vasoconstrictor and adequate lighting with a fiber-&#173;optic headlight. In more difficult cases, an endoscope can be used, and medialization of the inferior turbinate is sometimes performed. The lacrimal stent can be secured with a &#173;simple square knot, which allows removal of the stent through the canalicular system in a retrograde fashion. Alternatively, the lacrimal stent may be directly sutured to the lateral wall of the nose (without tension), or the limbs of the stent can be secured by passing them through &#173;either a silicone band or a sponge in the inferior meatus of the nose.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Another option is a self-&#173;retaining bicanalicular lacrimal stent that comes preloaded with a rigid inserter and does not require intranasal retrieval or fixation (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-9">Fig&#160;15-9A</span>). Alternatively, a monocanalicular stent is useful for patients with only one patent canaliculus (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-9B</span>). This type of stent is passed through a single punctum to the nasal cavity, where the end of the stent is allowed to rest loosely in the nose. The proximal end has a punctal plug and is self-&#173;secured at the punctum.</p>
				<p class="h3">Balloon dacryoplasty</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Balloon catheter dilation of the nasolacrimal canal has been used successfully in patients with congenital nasolacrimal obstruction. A collapsed balloon catheter is placed in a manner similar to probing and is inflated inside the duct. The role of this modality remains undefined, in part &#173;because the necessary catheter equipment is expensive, and &#173;because &#173;simple probing has a high success rate, obviating the need for further procedures.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Wladis&#160;EJ, Aakalu&#160;VK, Yen&#160;MT, Bilyk&#160;JR, Sobel&#160;RK, Mawn&#160;LA. Balloon dacryoplasty for congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction: a report by the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology. <span class="reference--journal--single_italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2018;125(10)1654–1657.</p>
				<p class="h3">Turbinate infracture</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the inferior turbinate appears to be lateralized against the NLD at the time of probing and irrigation, medial infracture of the inferior turbinate should be performed. The blunt end of a periosteal elevator is placed within the inferior meatus along the lateral surface of the inferior turbinate. The inferior turbinate is then rotated medially &#173;toward the septum. Fracturing the turbinate at its base significantly enlarges the inferior meatus and permits direct visualization of the lacrimal probe tip.</p>
				<p class="h3">Dacryocystorhinostomy</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is usually reserved for &#173;children who have per&#173;sis&#173;tent epiphora following intubation and/or balloon dacryoplasty, &#173;children who experience recurrent dacryocystitis, and patients with extensive developmental abnormalities of the nasolacrimal drainage system that prevent probing and intubation. DCR is more fully discussed &#173;later in this chapter, in the section&#160;Acquired Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction.</p>

			<div id="Chapt15_Top4">
				<p class="h2-h1">Evaluation</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">History</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with acquired tearing can be loosely divided into 2 groups: &#173;those with hypersecretion of tears (lacrimation or reflex tearing) and &#173;those with impairment of drainage (epiphora). The initial step in evaluating the tearing patient is differentiating between the 2 conditions. The following list aids in the assessment of the patient with acquired tearing:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">constant versus intermittent tearing</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">periods of remission versus no remission</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">unilateral versus bilateral condition</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">subjective ocular surface discomfort</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">history of allergies</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">use of topical medi&#173;cations such as glaucoma eyedrops</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">history of probing during childhood</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior ocular surface infections such as conjunctivitis or herpes simplex</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior sinus disease or surgery, midfacial trauma, or nasal fracture</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior treatment with radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">previous episodes of lacrimal sac inflammation</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">clear tears versus tears with discharge or blood (hemolacria, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-10">Fig&#160;15-10</span>)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h3">Examination</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systematic examination helps pinpoint the cause of acquired tearing. The initial step of the examination is to distinguish patients with obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system from &#173;those with secondary hypersecretion.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pseudoepiphora evaluation</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Epiphora</span> is defined as an overflow of tears. Some patients experience symptoms that they describe as their eyes having “too many tears,” but they do not exhibit frank epiphora. &#173;These sensations are often caused by other ocular or eyelid abnormalities. For example, patients with dry eyes may perceive foreign-&#173;body sensation or increased mucus production as excess tearing. However, they do not exhibit true overflow of tears over the eyelid margin or down the cheek. An assessment for pseudoepiphora includes the following considerations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list-first_italic">Tear meniscus.</span> The size and asymmetry of the lacrimal lake and presence of precipitated proteins and stringy mucus may indicate an abnormal tear film or outflow obstruction.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Tear breakup time.</span> To determine tear breakup time, fluorescein dye is instilled, and the patient is asked to refrain from blinking. The tear film is examined using a broad beam of a slit lamp with a cobalt-&#173;blue filter. A tear-&#173;film breakup time of less than 10 seconds may indicate poor function of the mucin or meibomian layer despite a sufficient amount of tears.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Evaluation of corneal and conjunctival epithelium.</span> Topical rose-&#173;bengal and lissamine-&#173;green dyes can aid in the detection of subtle ocular surface abnormalities by staining devitalized conjunctival and corneal epithelium. Fluorescein staining indicates more severe tear film malfunction with epithelial loss.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Basal tear secretion.</span> Basal tear secretion can be mea&#173;sured with Schirmer testing (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-11">Fig&#160;15-11</span>). (See also BCSC <span class="bullet-list-mid_xref-local">Section&#160;8</span>, <span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion of tear film tests and tear film abnormalities.)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Corneal irritation.</span> Irritation of the ocular surface is a common cause of secondary hypersecretion. This can be seen in individuals with misdirected eyelashes (trichiasis, distichiasis) or eyelid malposition (entropion). Other ocular irritants include allergy, chronic infection (eg, chlamydia or molluscum), and &#173;giant papillary conjunctivitis from contact lens wear. Careful examination of the palpebral conjunctiva can aid in the identification of such disorders.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h3">Lacrimal outflow examination</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination of a patient with abnormal lacrimal outflow begins with an observation of the eyelid and puncta positions during the blink cycle. Facial nerve dysfunction can result in a weakened blink and poor lacrimal pump function. An enlarged caruncle or conjunctivochalasis (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-12">Fig&#160;15-12</span>) can also mechanically block the aperture of the puncta and lead to tearing. Punctal stenosis, occlusion, or aplasia may be pre&#173;sent.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Palpation of the lacrimal sac may cause reflux of mucoid or mucopurulent material through the canalicular system, confirming complete NLDO. Further diagnostic tests are needed if a lacrimal sac tumor is suspected. Nasal examination may uncover an unsuspected cause of the epiphora, such as an intranasal tumor or polyp, turbinate impaction, deviated septum, or chronic allergic rhinitis. &#173;These conditions may occlude the nasal end of the NLD.</p>
				<p class="h3">Diagnostic tests</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical evaluation of the lacrimal drainage system historically comprised a <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">dye disappearance test (DDT)</span> followed by the Jones I test (swabbing the inferior meatus to see if dye passes through physiologically) and the Jones II test (irrigating with saline and assessing the passage of fluid and presence or absence of dye). Although some clinicians continue to rely on formal Jones testing, most use a simplified approach involving only the DDT and lacrimal irrigation.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The DDT is useful for assessing the presence or absence of adequate lacrimal outflow, especially in unilateral cases. It is more heavi&#173;ly relied upon for &#173;children, in whom lacrimal irrigation is difficult without deep sedation. Fluorescein is instilled in both eyes, and the tear film is observed with the cobalt-&#173;blue filter. Per&#173;sis&#173;tence of significant dye over a 5-&#173;minute period implies decreased outflow. Asymmetry in dye clearance during the DDT can be a particularly helpful diagnostic clue (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-13">Fig&#160;15-13)</span>. If the DDT result is normal, severe lacrimal drainage dysfunction is unlikely. However, intermittent &#173;causes of tearing, such as an allergy, dacryolith, or intranasal obstruction, cannot be ruled out.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Lacrimal drainage system irrigation</span> is most frequently performed &#173;after the DDT to determine the level of obstruction (Video&#160;15-1). &#173;After instillation of topical anesthesia, the inferior punctum is dilated if needed, and the irrigating cannula is placed in the canalicular system. To prevent canalicular kinking and difficulty in advancing the irrigating cannula, the clinician maintains lateral traction of the lower eyelid (see <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local" id="Fig 15-6">Fig&#160;15-6</span>). Canalicular stenosis or occlusion should be recorded and confirmed by subsequent diagnostic probing. Once the irrigating cannula has been advanced into the horizontal canaliculus, clear saline is injected, and the pattern of flow is noted. Careful observation and interpretation determine the site of obstruction without additional testing.</p>

				<p class="body-text">If saline irrigation passes freely into the nose with no reflux through the canalicular system, an anatomically <span class="body-text_italic">patent nasolacrimal drainage system</span> is pre&#173;sent. However, it is impor&#173;tant to note that even though this irrigation is successful &#173;under increased hydrostatic pressure from the irrigating syringe, a <span class="body-text_italic">functional obstruction</span> may still be pre&#173;sent. A dacryolith may also impair tear flow without blocking irrigation.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Diagnostic probing</span> of the upper system (puncta, canaliculi, and lacrimal sac) is useful in confirming the level of obstruction. In adults, this procedure can be performed easily with topical anesthesia. A small probe is used initially to detect any canalicular obstruction. If an obstruction is encountered, the probe is clamped at the punctum before withdrawal, thereby mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the distance to the obstruction. A larger probe may be useful to determine the extent of a partial obstruction, but the probe should not be forced through any area of re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Diagnostic probing of the NLD is not used in adults &#173;because &#173;there are other means of diagnosing NLDO. In addition, probing in adults has &#173;limited therapeutic value &#173;because it rarely produces lasting patency. In contrast, probing in infants is a useful and largely successful procedure. This reflects the differing pathophysiologies of congenital NLDO and acquired NLDO: the former often results from occlusion of the distal end of the NLD by a thin membrane, while the latter is caused by extensive fibrosis of the duct itself.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Intranasal examination is performed with a nasal speculum and light source. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy can be helpful in the evaluation of the nasal anatomy and in the identification of disease pro&#173;cesses.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Contrast dacryocystography</span> and <span class="body-text_italic">dacryoscintigraphy</span> are alternative methods of evaluation. Contrast dacryocystography, which involves injection of dye into the lacrimal system followed by computerized digital subtraction imaging, provides anatomical information of any obstructed sites. In dacryoscintigraphy, a physiologic picture of lacrimal outflow is obtained by using radionucleotide eyedrops to follow tear flow on a scintigram.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Computed tomography (CT)</span> and <span class="body-text_italic">MRI</span> are useful in the evaluation of craniofacial injury, congenital craniofacial deformities, and suspected neoplasia. CT is superior for the evaluation of suspected bony abnormalities, such as fractures. MRI is superior for the evaluation of suspected soft-&#173;tissue disease, such as malignancy. &#173;Either CT or MRI may be helpful in evaluating concomitant sinus or nasal disease that may contribute to excess tearing.</p>
				<p class="h2">Punctal Disorders</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several punctal abnormalities can result in epiphora. Puncta may be stenotic, too large (usually iatrogenic), malpositioned, or occluded by adjacent structures.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Punctal stenosis and occlusion can be due to numerous &#173;causes, including</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">congenital conditions</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">inflammatory diseases<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">posterior blepharitis</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">mucous membrane pemphigoid (ocular cicatricial pemphigoid)</li></ul></li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">infectious diseases (eg, herpes)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">iatrogenic &#173;causes<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">glaucoma medi&#173;cations</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list-last _idGenParaOverride-1">deliberate occlusion in the treatment of dry eye disease (plugs, cautery)</li></ul></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Punctal stenosis may be associated with punctal ectropion or atrophy in the absence of tear flow. It may be treated with dilation, punctoplasty, or stenting. Most often, the benefits of dilation are short-&#173;lived, and punctoplasty is required. This is usually accomplished with a snip procedure, in which a small portion of the ampulla is excised. If stenosis recurs, stenting may be required during healing to prevent contraction. Treatment of complete occlusion consists of surgical canalization and, in most cases, stenting.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Abnormally large puncta can also cause epiphora due to disruption of the lacrimal pump. The expanded opening prevents formation of an adequate seal when the eyes are closed, interfering with the usual development of negative pressure needed to drain the tears. Punctal enlargement is typically iatrogenic in nature and can occur from “cheese-&#173;wiring” of a stent secured too tight intranasally (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-16">Fig&#160;15-16</span>), punctoplasty, excision of adjacent lesions, or even from rough dilation and probing that cause damage to the normal fibrous ring around the punctum. Damage to the puncta may be difficult to correct.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If the punctum is not in the tear lake, the anatomical abnormality (most commonly ectropion) must be addressed by a medial spindle conjunctivoplasty or horizontal eyelid tightening (see <span class="body-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span> in this volume for more on both topics). Punctal stenosis may require punctoplasty. Puncta may also become obstructed by adjacent structures, such as a hypertrophied caruncle or conjunctivochalasis (see <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;15-12</span>), which can be corrected by reducing excess tissue.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Canalicular Obstruction</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Evaluation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Obstruction can occur within the upper, lower, or common canaliculus. The location of the obstruction is detected by a tactile soft stop during diagnostic probing (typically, the probe would reach a hard stop in the fossa of the lacrimal sac on contact with the lacrimal bone). <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">Total common canalicular obstruction</span> is characterized by high-&#173;velocity reflux from the opposite canaliculus (see <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure-local">Figs&#160;15-14, 15-15</span>, and Video&#160;15-2), with no flow into the lacrimal sac during lacrimal system irrigation. <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">Partial obstruction</span> may be discovered during lacrimal system irrigation when &#173;there is partial fluid flow into the nose and partial reflux around the cannula or through the opposite punctum. In some instances, a partial obstruction may represent a <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">total functional occlusion</span> due to weakness of the lacrimal pump or inability of tears to pass through the partial obstruction &#173;under normal physiologic conditions (as opposed to the high hydrostatic pressure from irrigation).</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Etiology</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Lacrimal plugs</span> Punctal and canalicular plugs used in the treatment of dry eye disease come in vari&#173;ous shapes and sizes. Punctal plugs that are too small may migrate within the canaliculus and result in obstruction, with associated inflammation or infection. The permanent intracanalicular plug can lead to infection. Even temporary or absorbable plugs have been known to cause a local inflammatory response and canalicular constriction. Canalicular probing is used to identify the location of the problematic plug, which is then surgically excised. Often, excision of a short segment of scarred canaliculus is required, which is then repaired with a technique similar to reconstruction following trauma or &#173;after injury of the canaliculus during excision of a neoplasm.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Medi&#173;cation</span> Systemic medi&#173;cations can also cause canalicular obstruction. Chemotherapeutic agents, including 5-&#173;fluorouracil and docetaxel, are secreted in the tear film, leading to inflammation and scarring of the canaliculi. Use of topical ste&#173;roid eyedrops and artificial tears during chemotherapy may prevent scarring. If this condition is identified early—&#173;before the obstruction is complete—&#173;stents can be placed to prevent progression while the patient completes the course of chemotherapy. A special canalicular-&#173;only stent is available for &#173;these cases. Less commonly, canalicular obstruction has been reported &#173;after the use of topical medi&#173;cation (eg, phospholine iodide, eserine, idoxuridine).</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Infection</span> Numerous infections can cause canalicular obstruction. Most frequently, obstruction occurs concurrently with diffuse conjunctival infection (eg, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus). Isolated canalicular infection (canaliculitis; discussed &#173;later in this chapter) can also result in obstruction.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inflammatory disease</span> Inflammatory conditions such as mucous membrane pemphigoid (ocular cicatricial pemphigoid), Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome, and graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease often cause loss of the puncta and/or canaliculi. However, &#173;because of concurrent loss of tear secretion, patients often do not experience epiphora.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Trauma</span> Traumatic injury to the canaliculi can result in permanent damage if the injury is not managed in a timely, appropriate manner.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Neoplasm</span> When a neoplasm is pre&#173;sent in the medial canthal area, complete resection may include removal of the puncta and canaliculi. When the distal lacrimal drainage system remains intact, the remaining portion of the canaliculi may be marsupialized to the conjunctival surface with or without lacrimal intubation.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Management</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Canalicular stenting</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Intubation</span> or <span class="h4-text_italic">stenting</span> of the lacrimal drainage system should be considered as a first-&#173;line therapy whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Intubation of the nasolacrimal drainage system can usually be performed successfully when the patient has symptomatic canalicular constriction but not complete occlusion. For canalicular scarring, the use of a balloon catheter alone is usually not sufficient to correct the condition.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Reconstruction</span> Reconstruction of an obstructed canaliculus is often successful when only a few millimeters are involved. If a &#173;limited area of total occlusion is discovered near the punctum, the occluded canaliculus can be resected and the cut ends of the canaliculus anastomosed over a stent. For distal obstructions, including the common canaliculus, trephination with lacrimal stenting can be useful. This is most successful for distal monocanalicular obstructions, followed by distal bicanalicular, common, and proximal obstructions.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Canaliculodacryocystorhinostomy</span> If the common canaliculus is totally obstructed or the lacrimal sac is sclerotic, a canaliculodacryocystorhinostomy or canaliculorhinostomy may be performed. In &#173;these procedures, the area of total common canalicular obstruction is removed, and the remaining patent canalicular system is directly anastomosed to the lacrimal sac mucosa or the lateral nasal wall mucosa with placement of a lacrimal stent.</p>
				<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy</span> When 1 or both canaliculi are severely obstructed, a CDCR may be required. This procedure creates a complete bypass of the lacrimal drainage system. The beginning of this surgical technique is similar to a DCR (described &#173;later in this chapter) and is followed by placement of a glass tube through a tract created from the caruncle into the &#173;middle nasal meatus. The surgeon should have tubes of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent lengths available at the time of surgery to ensure implantation of a tube that emerges clearly in the nose without abutting the nasal septum (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure">Video 15-3</span>, <span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-17">Fig 15-17</span>).</p>

				<p class="body-text">A diligent discussion of eyelid hygiene and tube maintenance is imperative prior to surgery &#173;because postoperative care can be troublesome and frustrating for the patient. A daily routine consisting of nasal lavage with saline solution and “snuffing” of artificial tears through the tube can clear mucus debris and prevent obstruction. During office examination, irrigation of saline through the tube may clear any clogging from proteinaceous debris. In general, a tube that is well tolerated and functional does not require removal. Periodically, it may require replacement; if this is necessary, the appropriate size should be available for immediate replacement to avoid contracture of the CDCR tract. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea may be both&#173;ered by air reflux onto the ocular surface from the continuous positive airway pressure machine. This can sometimes be alleviated by switching to a full-&#173;face mask, but may be so bothersome that tube removal is necessary. Despite &#173;these drawbacks, CDCR helps many patients with other&#173;wise intractable epiphora.</p>
				<p class="h2">Acquired Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An NLDO usually can be diagnosed with irrigation. By and large, NLDO is a relatively benign condition, and clinicians tend to proceed directly to a discussion of surgery. Although most cases are routine, alternative &#173;causes of NLDO merit consideration.</p>
				<p class="h3">Etiology</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Involutional stenosis</span> Involutional stenosis is prob&#173;ably the most common cause of NLDO. It affects &#173;women twice as frequently as men. Although the inciting event in this pro&#173;cess is unknown, clinicopathologic study suggests that inflammatory infiltrates and edema cause compression of the lumen of the NLD. This may be the result of anatomical predisposition, unidentified infection, or possibly autoimmune disease. Management almost always consists of DCR.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Dacryolith</span> Dacryoliths, or concretions formed within the lacrimal sac (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-18">Fig&#160;15-18</span>), can also obstruct the NLD. Dacryoliths consist of shed epithelial cells, lipids, and amorphous debris with or without calcium. In most cases, no inciting event or abnormality is identified. Occasionally, infection with <span class="h4-text_italic">Actinomyces israelii</span> or <span class="h4-text_italic">Candida</span> species or long-&#173;term administration of topical medi&#173;cations such as epinephrine can lead to the formation of concretions. Depending on their position, they can sometimes result in intermittent NLDO symptoms, and acute impaction of a dacryolith in the NLD can produce lacrimal sac distention and pain. Dacryoliths are easily removed during DCR.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Sinus and nasal disease</span> Sinus disease often occurs in conjunction with, and may contribute to, the development of NLDO. Clinicians should inquire about previous sinus surgery &#173;because the NLD is sometimes inadvertently damaged during sinus procedures. Similarly, nasal conditions such as polyps, chronic congestion, a deviated septum, and prior nasal surgery can also contribute to NLDO.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Trauma</span> Naso-&#173;orbital fractures may involve the NLD. Early treatment with fracture reduction and stenting of the entire lacrimal drainage system should be considered. However, such injuries are often not recognized or are initially neglected while more serious injuries are managed. Injuries may also occur during rhinoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery. In &#173;these cases, late treatment of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epiphora usually requires DCR.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inflammatory disease</span> Granulomatous disease, including sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-19">Fig&#160;15-19</span>), and extranodal NK/T-&#173;cell lymphoma, may also lead to NLDO. When systemic disease is suspected, a biopsy of the lacrimal sac or the NLD performed at the time of DCR may provide additional diagnostic input.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Lacrimal plugs</span> Dislodged punctal and canalicular plugs can migrate and occlude the NLD. As with most forms of NLDO, treatment consists of DCR. Retained segments of an incompletely removed lacrimal stent may also cause NLDO.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Radioactive iodine</span> Therapeutic radioactive iodine for the treatment of thyroid cancer may also lead to closure of the lacrimal apparatus &#173;because of local uptake by the Na<span class="h4-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>/I (sodium/iodide) symporter (NIS) found in the mucosa of the sac and duct. This is not seen with the lower dosages used to treat the thyroid gland in patients with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves disease).</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Neoplasm</span> Neoplasm should be considered as a pos&#173;si&#173;ble etiology in any patient presenting with NLDO. In patients with an aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, including younger age and male sex, further workup should be considered. Hemolacria (see <span class="h4-text_xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;15-10</span>) as well as lacrimal sac distention above the medial canthal tendon are suggestive of neoplasm. A history of malignancy, especially of sinus or nasopharyngeal origin, warrants further investigation. When malignancy is suspected, appropriate imaging studies (CT and/or MRI) should be obtained. Preoperative endoscopy can be performed to evaluate for intranasal neoplasm. In addition, if an unexpected mass or other abnormality suggestive of neoplasm is encountered during surgery, a biopsy specimen should be obtained.</p>
				<p class="body-text">When a neoplasm is found to contribute to NLDO, initial treatment focuses on the tumor. In patients with a benign tumor, a DCR or CDCR can be performed. In patients with a malignant tumor, the surgical correction of the nasolacrimal drainage system should be postponed &#173;until &#173;there is certainty of clear margins or &#173;there is a disease-&#173;free interval, &#173;after which a DCR or CDCR may be undertaken. Tumors of the lacrimal sac and NLD are discussed in further detail &#173;later in this chapter, in the section titled Neoplasm.</p>
				<p class="h3">Management</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Intubation and stenting</span> Partial stenosis of the NLD with symptomatic epiphora may respond to surgical intubation of the entire lacrimal drainage system. This procedure should be performed only if the tubes can be passed easily. In cases of complete NLDO, intubation alone is not effective, and a DCR should be considered.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Dacryocystorhinostomy</span> A DCR is the treatment of choice for most patients with acquired NLDO. Surgical indications include recurrent dacryocystitis, chronic mucoid reflux, painful distention of the lacrimal sac, and bothersome epiphora. For patients with dacryocystitis, active infection should be treated, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, before a DCR is performed.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Although &#173;there are many variations in surgical techniques, all of them create an anastomosis between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity through a bony ostium. One significant distinction among techniques is &#173;whether the surgeon uses an internal (intranasal) approach or the more traditional external (transcutaneous) approach. In both approaches, bicanalicular lacrimal stenting is usually performed at the end of the procedure.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Recent data indicate similar success rates for the 2 approaches. The advantages of an <span class="body-text_italic">internal (endonasal) DCR</span> include lack of a vis&#173;i&#173;ble scar, a shorter recovery period, and less discomfort. An <span class="body-text_italic">external DCR</span> may allow better exposure for management of canalicular stenosis, unexpected neoplasm, or dacryoliths.</p>
				<p class="body-text">DCR can be performed &#173;under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with intravenous sedation. Intraoperative hemostasis can be enhanced by preoperative injection of lidocaine with epinephrine into the medial canthal soft tissues and by the use of intranasally injected anesthetic and nasal packing with vasoconstrictive agents (eg, oxymetazoline hydrochloride, phenylephrine, epinephrine, or cocaine hydrochloride). In external DCR (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-20">Figs&#160;15-20</span>, <span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-21">15-21</span>), the skin incision should be made to avoid the angular blood vessels and prevent wound contractures leading to epicanthal folds. The osteotomy adjacent to the medial wall of the lacrimal sac can be created with a hemostat, rongeur, trephine, or drill. An anteriorly positioned ethmoidal air cell may require removal to properly drain into the nasal cavity. A large osteotomy site facilitates the formation of posterior and anterior mucosal flaps from both the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa. To avoid scarring and subsequent failure of the procedure, it is impor&#173;tant for the surgeon to minimize trauma to the common internal ostium of the canaliculi when the lacrimal sac flaps are created. Suturing of the corresponding posterior flaps and anterior flaps is common, but sometimes only anterior flaps are anastomosed.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Endonasal DCR consists of removal of the nasal mucosa over the area corresponding to the nasolacrimal sac and duct (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-22">Fig&#160;15-22</span>), followed by an osteotomy to remove the frontal pro&#173;cess of the maxillary bone and the lacrimal bone that cover the lacrimal sac (Video&#160;15-4). To allow proper exposure of the lacrimal sac, the surgeon may also need to remove the uncinate pro&#173;cess or an anteriorly located ethmoidal air cell. The lacrimal sac is then opened, and the medial wall of the sac is removed; this marsupializes the sac into the nose. Careful se&#173;lection of patients with adequate nasal cavities is crucial for success, and the surgeon should be prepared to modify the nasal anatomy for better exposure and access (eg, by performing nasal septoplasty). Several variations of endonasal DCR exist, including direct visualization or visualization with the use of an endoscope <span class="body-text_italic">(endoscopic DCR).</span> Some surgeons use a fiber-&#173;optic probe passed through a canaliculus to transilluminate the lacrimal sac.</p>

				<p class="body-text">Although DCRs are successful in most patients, failures do occur. DCR failures may be caused by fibrosis and occlusion of the osteotomy; common canalicular obstruction; incomplete opening of the inferior lacrimal sac, which &#173;causes a sump syndrome (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-23">Fig&#160;15-23A</span>); inappropriate placement or size of the bony ostium; or scarring between the soft tissue ostium and the nasal septum. Treatment of a sump syndrome is aimed &#173;toward removal of this residual inferior bone through an external or endonasal approach (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-23B</span>). The outcome of the DCR is also influenced by other &#173;factors, including the patient’s history of trauma, coexisting autoimmune inflammatory disease, the presence of active dacryocystitis, the development of postoperative infection, and hypersensitivity or foreign-&#173;body reactions to the stent. When an initial DCR fails, some surgeons apply topical mitomycin to the surgical site during reoperation. This potent antiproliferative alkylating agent helps prevent fibrosis at the osteotomy site.</p>
				<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Microendoscopy with lacrimal duct recanalization</span> The use of a microendoscope allows for exploration and direct visualization of NLDOs as well as minimally invasive therapeutic techniques such as &#173;laser dacryoplasty and microdrill dacryoplasty to reopen the NLD. &#173;These interventions attempt to maintain the anatomy of lacrimal drainage system with a focal surgical intervention for recanalization. Some studies have reported success rates nearing &#173;those for DCR. The use of this technology is not widespread &#173;because regulatory approval has not yet been given.</p>

			<div id="Chapt15_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases of severe dry eye disease, occlusion of the lacrimal puncta may be helpful. Dissolvable collagen plugs may be used on a trial basis, or permanent silicone plugs may be used. Permanent intracanalicular plugs are not recommended. Although punctal plugs are usually well tolerated, complications are occasionally encountered. Minor prob&#173;lems include ocular surface irritation and a foreign-&#173;body reaction. Pyogenic granulomas may develop, requiring removal of the plugs. More serious complications usually relate to plug displacement.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Plug extrusion</span> or <span class="body-text_italic">migration</span> is not uncommon. The ophthalmologist can best avoid &#173;these complications by using a plugs that are the appropriate size. When appropriately fitted, punctal plugs usually stay in place. However, if a plug migrates within the lacrimal drainage system, obstruction of &#173;either the canaliculus or the NLD can result. <span class="body-text_italic">Canaliculitis</span> may result from canalicular plugs or from punctal plugs that have migrated into the canaliculus.</p>
				<p class="body-text">When occlusion with plugs is not successful, the clinician may consider surgical occlusion. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases and must be performed with caution. Once the decision has been made to proceed with surgical occlusion, the puncta are closed in a stepwise fashion, one punctum at a time.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;There are numerous surgical techniques for occluding the lacrimal drainage system. <span class="body-text_italic">Thermal obliteration</span> of the puncta and adjacent canaliculi can be performed with a handheld cautery unit or a needle-&#173;tip unipolar cautery unit. <span class="body-text_italic">Ampullectomy</span> can be performed with &#173;either direct closure or placement of an overlying conjunctival graft. Often, despite aggressive attempts, the puncta persist or reform. In &#173;these recalcitrant cases, the punctal and adjacent canalicular epithelia can be completely excised, or the canaliculus can be transected and reconstructed with the severed ends offset from one another.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top6">
				<p class="h2-h1">Canaliculus</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic injuries to the canaliculi occur &#173;either by direct laceration or by avulsion, when sudden lateral displacement of the eyelid tears the medial canthal tendon and associated canaliculus. &#173;Because it lacks tarsal support, the canaliculus lies within the weakest part of the eyelid and is often the first structure to yield. Therefore, when such an injury is suspected in cases of trauma, careful inspection of this area is mandatory, including diagnostic canalicular probing and irrigation. &#173;Because the success rate of primary repair is much higher than that of secondary reconstruction, most surgeons recommend repair of all canalicular lacerations.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The first step of the repair is locating the severed ends of the canalicular system. General anesthesia and magnification with optimal illumination facilitate the search. A thorough understanding of the medial canthal anatomy guides the surgeon to the appropriate area to begin exploration for the medial end of the severed canaliculus. Laterally, the canaliculus is located near the eyelid margin, but for lacerations close to the lacrimal sac, the canaliculus is deep to the anterior limb of the medial canthal tendon (see &#173;<span class="body-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>, <span class="body-text_xref-local">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). Irrigation using air, fluorescein, or yellow viscoelastic material through an intact adjacent canaliculus may be helpful. The use of methylene blue dye should be avoided, as it tends to stain the entire operative field. In difficult cases, the careful use of a smooth-&#173;tipped pigtail probe may help identify the medial cut end. The probe is introduced through the opposite, uninvolved punctum; passed through the common canaliculus; and fi&#173;nally passed through the medial cut end.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Stenting of the injured canaliculus is essential to help prevent postoperative canalicular strictures. By placing the stent on traction &#173;after it has been passed through the NLD, the surgeon draws together the severed canalicular ends and other soft-&#173;tissue structures, situating them back in their normal anatomical positions. Direct anastomosis of the canaliculus over the lacrimal stent can be accomplished with closure of the pericanalicular tissues, and the medial canthal tendon and eyelid margin can be reconstructed as necessary.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Traditionally, bicanalicular stents have been used, but monocanalicular stents are also available. One type of monocanalicular stent is attached distally to a metal guiding probe that is retrieved intranasally. Another type is inserted into the punctum and threaded directly into the lacerated canaliculus to bridge the laceration but does not extend into the nose. This allows the procedure to be performed &#173;under local anesthesia in the office or the emergency department.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Stents are typically left in place for 3 months or longer. However, cheese-&#173;wiring, ocular irritation, infection, local inflammation, or pyogenic granuloma formation may necessitate early removal. Bicanalicular stents are usually cut at the medial canthus and retrieved from the nose. Monocanalicular stents are simply retrieved from the punctum.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Lacrimal Sac and Nasolacrimal Duct</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lacrimal sac and NLD may be injured by direct laceration or by fracture of the surrounding bones. Injuries of the lacrimal sac or NLD may also occur during rhinoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery when the physiologic maxillary sinus ostium is being enlarged anteriorly. Alternatively, placement of maxillofacial hardware during midface reconstruction or fracture repair may result in violation of the nasolacrimal anatomy with resultant obstruction. Early treatment of the lacrimal sac and NLD is appropriate and consists of fracture reduction, soft-&#173;tissue repair, and lacrimal intubation of the entire drainage system. Late treatment of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epiphora may require DCR.</p>

			<p class="h1">Infection</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top7">
				<p class="h2-h1">Dacryoadenitis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute inflammation of the lacrimal gland <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">(dacryoadenitis)</span> is most often seen in association with inflammatory disease and occasionally is the consequence of malignancy, such as lymphoproliferative disease. Noninfectious disease of the lacrimal gland is covered in <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>. Infectious dacryoadenitis is unusual, and gross purulence and abscess formation are uncommon. However, with the emergence of community-&#173;acquired methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),</span> this condition is seen more frequently. Most cases are the result of bacterial infection, which may develop secondary to an adjacent infection, &#173;after trauma, or hematogenously. Alternatively, MRSA infection may appear without preexisting risk &#173;factors. Given the rare occurrence of &#173;these infections, large case series are lacking. Presumably, most infections are due to gram-&#173;positive bacteria, but cases resulting from gram-&#173;negative bacteria have been documented as have rare reports of tuberculosis dacryoadenitis. Epstein-&#173;Barr virus is the most frequently reported viral pathogen. Many nonsuppurative cases are treated empirically, without isolation of the alleged pathogen; coverage for MRSA infection in such cases should be considered.</p>
				<p class="h2">Canaliculitis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Canaliculitis pre&#173;sents with per&#173;sis&#173;tent weeping and discharge, sometimes accompanied by a follicular conjunctivitis centered in the medial canthus. The punctum is often erythematous and dilated, or “pouting.” A cotton-&#173;tipped applicator can be used to apply pressure to the canaliculus (“milking”). The expression of purulent discharge confirms the diagnosis (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-24">Fig&#160;15-24</span>). A variety of bacteria, viruses, and mycotic organisms can cause infection within the canaliculus, most commonly <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">Actinomyces israelii.</span></p>
				<p class="body-text">Canaliculitis can be difficult to eradicate. Conservative management consists of warm compresses, digital compression, and topical and sometimes oral antibiotic therapy. Culture of the discharge may be useful in identifying the cause of the infection. Many patients require more aggressive treatment, particularly &#173;those with dacryoliths or a retained intracanalicular plug, which can prevent eradication of the organism. Curettage through the punctum is sometimes successful at removing multiple stones, but often a canaliculotomy is required to completely remove all particulate &#173;matter. Drainage can be facilitated by an incision through the puncta or through the canaliculus (Video&#160;15-5). The incision is left open to heal by second intention and does not usually require stenting. Some surgeons irrigate or paint the canaliculus with povidone-&#173;iodine or irrigate with specially formulated penicillin-&#173;fortified eyedrops perioperatively.</p>

				<p class="h2">Dacryocystitis</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammation of the lacrimal sac <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">(acute dacryocystitis)</span> is usually due to complete NLDO, which prevents normal drainage from the lacrimal sac into the nose. Chronic tear retention and stasis lead to secondary infection. Clinical findings include edema and erythema with distention of the lacrimal sac (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-25">Fig&#160;15-25</span>). The degree of discomfort ranges from none to severe pain. Complications include dacryocystocele formation, chronic conjunctivitis, and spread to adjacent structures (orbital or facial cellulitis).</p>
				<p class="body-text">The following treatments may be used to address acute dacryocystitis:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list-first_italic">Oral antibiotics.</span> Oral antibiotics are effective for most infections. Gram-&#173;positive bacteria are the most common cause of acute dacryocystitis. However, the clinician should suspect gram-&#173;negative organisms in patients who have diabetes mellitus or are immunocompromised and in &#173;those who have been exposed to aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pathogens (eg, individuals residing in nursing homes).</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Parenteral antibiotics.</span> Parenteral antibiotics may be necessary for the treatment of severe cases, especially if cellulitis or orbital extension is pre&#173;sent.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-last_italic">Incision and drainage.</span> A localized abscess involving the lacrimal sac and adjacent soft tissues may require incision and drainage but should be reserved for cases that do not respond to more conservative mea&#173;sures or for patients in severe discomfort.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Aspiration of the lacrimal sac.</span> This procedure may be performed if a pyocele or mucocele is localized and approaching the skin. Smears and cultures of the aspirate may inform the se&#173;lection of systemic antibiotic therapy.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list-first_italic">Irrigation or probing.</span> Irrigation or probing of the canalicular system should be avoided &#173;until the infection subsides. In most cases, irrigation is not needed to establish the diagnosis, and it is extremely painful for patients with active infection. Probing of the NLD is not indicated in adults with acute dacryocystitis.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list-last_italic">Application of topical antibiotics.</span> Topical antibiotics are of &#173;limited value. They do not reach the site of the infection &#173;because of stasis within the lacrimal drainage system. They also do not penetrate sufficiently within the adjacent soft tissue.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Dacryocystitis indicating total NLDO requires a DCR in most cases &#173;because of inevitable per&#173;sis&#173;tent epiphora and recurrent infection. In general, external surgery is deferred &#173;until the acute inflammation is resolved. However, endonasal DCR can safely be performed for acute infection. Some patients, however, continue to have a subacute infection &#173;until definitive drainage surgery is performed.</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Chronic dacryocystitis,</span> a smoldering low-&#173;grade infection, may develop in some individuals. It may result in distention of the lacrimal sac, and massage may reflux mucoid material through the canalicular system onto the surface of the eye. If a tumor is not suspected, no further diagnostic evaluation is indicated to confirm the diagnosis of total NLDO. Chronic dacryocystitis is treated before elective intraocular surgery.</p>

				<p class="h2">Lacrimal Drainage System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neoplastic &#173;causes of acquired obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system may be classified into the following groups:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">primary lacrimal drainage system tumors (most commonly papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma; <span class="bullet-list-first_xref-figure" id="Fig 15-26">Fig&#160;15-26</span>)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">primary tumors of tissues surrounding the lacrimal drainage system that secondarily invade or compromise lacrimal system structures (most commonly basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelid skin; &#173;others include adenoid cystic carcinoma, infantile [capillary] hemangioma, inverted papilloma, epidermoid carcinoma, osteoma, and lymphoma)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">tumors metastatic to the nasolacrimal region</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="body-text_italic">Primary lacrimal sac tumors</span> are rare and should be considered for any mass that pre&#173;sents above the medial canthal tendon. They may be associated with epiphora or chronic dacryocystitis. Some patients report spontaneous bleeding; blood may also reflux from the punctum on irrigation (see <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local" id="Fig 15-10">Fig&#160;15-10</span>). Tumors that invade the skin may produce ulceration with telangiectasia over the lacrimal sac. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes may also occur. CT and MRI have replaced dacryocystography as the way to identify neoplasms and determine disease extent. CT also has the advantage of facilitating the assessment of bone erosion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">On histologic examination, approximately 45% of lacrimal sac tumors are benign and 55% are malignant. Squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas are the most common tumors of the sac. Many papillomas initially grow in an inverted pattern and into the lacrimal sac wall; consequently, their excision is often incomplete. With recurrence, malignant degeneration may occur.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Treatment of benign lacrimal sac tumors commonly requires a <span class="body-text_italic">dacryocystectomy</span> (surgical extirpation of the lacrimal sac)<span class="body-text_italic">.</span> Malignant tumors require a dacryocystectomy combined with a lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy, which are often performed in concert with a head and neck surgeon. <span class="body-text_italic">Exenteration,</span> including bone removal in the medial canthal area, is necessary if a malignant epithelial tumor involves bone and the soft tissues of the orbit (see <span class="body-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). <span class="body-text_italic">Radiation</span> is useful for treatment of lymphomatous lesions, as an adjuvant &#173;after removal of malignant lesions, and as a palliative mea&#173;sure for unresectable lesions.</p>
