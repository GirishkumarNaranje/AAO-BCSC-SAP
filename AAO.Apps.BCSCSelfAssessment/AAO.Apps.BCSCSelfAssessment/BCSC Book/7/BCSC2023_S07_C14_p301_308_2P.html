			<p class="h1">Development</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top2">
				<p class="h2-h1">Secretory System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lacrimal gland develops from multiple solid ectodermal buds in the anterior superolateral orbit. &#173;These buds branch, canalize, and form ducts and alveoli. The lacrimal glands are small and do not function fully &#173;until approximately 6 weeks &#173;after birth. Thus, newborn infants do not produce tears when they cry.</p>
				<p class="h2">Drainage System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">By the end of the fifth week of gestation, the nasolacrimal groove forms as a furrow that lies between the nasal and maxillary prominences. In the floor of this groove, the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) develops from a linear thickening of the ectoderm. A solid cord then separates from adjacent ectoderm and sinks into the mesenchyme. The cord canalizes, forming the NLD and the lacrimal sac at its cranial end. The canalicular system is an outgrowth of the lacrimal sac. Caudally, the developing duct extends intranasally, exiting within the inferior meatus. The central tissue of this cord eventually undergoes apoptosis, forming a lumen. Canalization of the NLD is usually complete around the time of birth. A&#160;residual membrane obstructing the distal aspect of the duct at the valve of Hasner represents the most common cause of congenital NLDO; it is symptomatic in approximately 5% to 20% of infants at birth. Patency usually occurs spontaneously within the first few months of life. As noted &#173;earlier, since tear production does not normally occur &#173;until 6&#160;weeks of age, excessive tearing may not be immediately obvious even if an obstruction exists.</p>

			<p class="h1">Anatomy</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
				<p class="h2-h1">Secretory System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lacrimal gland is an exocrine gland located in the superolateral orbit within the lacrimal gland fossa. Embryologic development of the lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis indents the lacrimal gland, dividing it into orbital and palpebral lobes (see <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;1-7</span>) as it traverses laterally to insert on the lateral orbital tubercle (Whitnall tubercle). The superior transverse ligament (Whitnall ligament) forms septa through the stroma of the gland, with some fibers also projecting onto the lateral orbital wall several millimeters above the lateral orbital tubercle.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Between 8 and 12 major lacrimal ducts empty into the superior cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac, which is located approximately 5&#160;mm above the lateral tarsal border, &#173;after passing posterior to the levator aponeurosis and through the M<span class="body-text_accent">ü</span>ller muscle and conjunctiva. &#173;Because the lacrimal excretory ducts traverse the palpebral portion of the gland, removal of the palpebral lobe may reduce secretion from the entire gland. Therefore, biopsy of the lacrimal gland is preferentially performed on the orbital lobe.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Ocular surface irritation activates tear production from the lacrimal gland. The ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, cranial nerve (CN) V, provides the sensory <span class="body-text_italic">(afferent)</span> pathway of the reflex tear arc. The <span class="body-text_italic">efferent</span> pathway is more complicated. Parasympathetic fibers that originate in the superior salivatory nucleus of the pons exit the brainstem with the facial nerve, CN VII (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 14-1">Fig&#160;14-1</span>). Lacrimal fibers leave CN VII as the greater superficial petrosal nerve and pass into the sphenopalatine ganglion. From &#173;there, they are believed to enter the lacrimal gland via the superior branch of the zygomatic nerve, through an anastomosis between the zygomaticotemporal nerve and the lacrimal nerve. It is unclear &#173;whether this anastomosis is uniformly pre&#173;sent. The role of the sympathetic ner&#173;vous system in lacrimation is not well understood.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="body-text_italic">accessory glands of Krause</span> and <span class="body-text_italic">Wolfring</span> are exocrine glands located deep within the superior fornix and just above the superior border of the tarsus, respectively. Aqueous lacrimal secretion has traditionally been divided into basal secretion and reflex secretion. Previously, it was thought that the accessory glands predominate in basal tear secretion, and that the lacrimal gland was responsible for reflex tearing. It is now believed that all glands respond as a unit.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The tear film is a uniform gel comprised of proteins and fluids secreted by the lacrimal gland and mucus from conjunctival goblet cells. The tear film creates a smooth optical surface, and the air–&#173;tear film interface is the primary refractive ele&#173;ment of the eye. In addition, the tear film contains a host of proteins that regulate the ocular flora. See BCSC <span class="body-text_xref-local">Section&#160;2</span>, <span class="body-text_italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> and BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="body-text_italic">Cornea and External Disease,</span> for more detailed discussions of the tear film.</p>
				<p class="h2">Drainage System</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tears enter the lacrimal drainage system through <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">puncta</span> located medially on the margin of the upper and lower eyelids (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 14-2">Fig&#160;14-2</span>). Each punctum appears at the apex of a fleshy papilla that protrudes slightly above the eyelid margin, and is slightly inverted and apposed to the globe, to rest within the tear lake. The inferior punctum is slightly more lateral than the superior punctum. The puncta are approximately 0.3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and lead to a vertical segment of the <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">lacrimal canaliculi</span> known as the ampulla. The canaliculi then turn 90°, continuing 8–10&#160;mm medially to join at the common canaliculus and connect with the <span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">lacrimal sac</span> through the valve of Rosenm<span class="body-text--no-indent-_accent">ü</span>ller. Less commonly, the canaliculi connect directly to the lacrimal sac without a common portion. The canaliculi are lined with nonkeratinized, non–&#173;mucin-&#173;producing stratified squamous epithelium. This epithelium transitions to a stratified columnar epithelium in the distal portion of the canaliculi, which continues through the lacrimal sac and NLD<span class="body-text--no-indent-_italic">.</span> For reasons that are not completely understood, the Na<span class="body-text--no-indent-_symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>/I (sodium/iodide) symporter (NIS) is pre&#173;sent in this epithelium, which can lead to stenosis during treatment with high-&#173;dose radioactive &#173;iodine for thyroid cancer.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The <span class="body-text_italic">valve of Rosenm</span><span class="body-text_accent_italic">ü</span><span class="body-text_italic">ller</span> (see <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-2</span>) is a fold of mucosal tissue that has traditionally been described as the structure that prevents reflux of tears from the sac into the canaliculi. However, studies suggest that the common canaliculus consistently bends from posterior to anterior &#173;behind the medial canthal tendon before entering the lacrimal sac at an acute &#173;angle. This bend, in conjunction with the fold of mucosa, may play a role in blocking reflux.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The lacrimal sac lies within a bony fossa bordered by the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests (see BCSC <span class="body-text_xref-local">Section&#160;2</span>, <span class="body-text_italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;1-1,</span> for a photo&#173;graph of this fossa). The medial canthal tendon is a complex structure composed of superior, anterior, and posterior crura that envelop the superior aspect of the lacrimal sac. The superficial head of the tendon attaches to the anterior lacrimal crest, and the deep head (with the Horner muscle) attaches to the posterior lacrimal crest. The medial wall of the fossa is composed of the lacrimal bone posteriorly and the frontal pro&#173;cess of the maxillary bone anteriorly. Medial to the fossa is the &#173;middle meatus of the nose, sometimes with intervening ethmoid air cells. From an intranasal view, the location of the lacrimal sac corresponds to the lateral nasal wall just anterior to the &#173;middle turbinate (<span class="body-text_xref-figure" id="Fig 14-3">Fig&#160;14-3</span>). The fundus of the sac, which is more fibrous than the rest of the sac, extends several millimeters above the medial canthal tendon. Inferiorly, the lacrimal sac transitions into the NLD<span class="body-text_italic">.</span> When performing an external dacryocystorhinostomy, the surgeon should be mindful of the angular artery and vein that lie medial to the medial canthal &#173;angle and thus avoid unnecessary bleeding. Additionally, careful blunt dissection &#173;will preserve distal fibers of the zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve and avoid temporary postoperative lagophthalmos.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In adults, the NLD mea&#173;sures 12–18&#160;mm in length. The intraosseous portion of the duct is typically 12&#160;mm long, and the meatal duct extends 5–6&#160;mm inferior to the bony ostium. The NLD travels through bone within the nasolacrimal canal, which initially curves in an inferior and slightly lateral and posterior direction from the lacrimal sac. The NLD opens into the nose through an ostium &#173;under the inferior turbinate (the inferior meatus), which is usually partially covered by a mucosal fold (the valve of Hasner; see <span class="body-text_xref-figure-local" id="Fig 14-2">Fig&#160;14-2</span>). The mucosal ostium in adults is typically located 30–35&#160;mm from the external naris.</p>

			<p class="h1">Physiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaporation accounts for approximately 10% of tear elimination. Most of the tear flow is actively pumped from the tear lake by the actions of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Blinking pushes tears first laterally and then nasally from the eyelid margin. When the eyelids open, negative pressure pulls the tears into the sac; when the eyelids close, the action of the orbicularis muscle creates positive pressure that forces &#173;those tears through the NLD (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure" id="Fig 14-4">Fig&#160;14-4</span>, Video&#160;14-1). A weakened blink interferes with the normal pumping mechanism and contributes to epiphora in patients with eyelid laxity or CN VII palsy.</p>
