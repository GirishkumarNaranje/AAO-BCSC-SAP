			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 5 surgical spaces within the orbit (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-1">Fig&#160;7-1</span>):</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">subperiosteal surgical space,</span> which is the potential space between the bone and the periorbita (periosteum of the orbit)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">extraconal surgical space</span>, which lies between the periorbita and the muscle cone</li>

				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbit can be further divided into anterior, &#173;middle, and posterior regions, and/or superior, inferior, medial, and lateral spaces, with pathology involving one or more orbital areas. Incision planning and approach may vary based on the depth of the pathology requiring surgery.</p>
				<p class="body-text">A single orbital lesion may involve more than 1 surgical space, and a combination of approaches may be necessary to address pathologic pro&#173;cesses affecting the orbit. An operating microscope is sometimes used, particularly for dissection inside the muscle cone. The approaches to &#173;these spaces—&#173;superior, inferior, medial, and lateral—&#173;are discussed in the following sections. Common incisions used to access &#173;these surgical spaces are shown in <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-2">Figure&#160;7-2</span>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Orbitotomy</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
				<p class="h2-h1">Superior Approach</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">More orbital lesions are found in the superoanterior part of the orbit than in any other location. Lesions in this area can usually be accessed through a transcutaneous incision (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-3">Fig&#160;7-3</span>). When this approach is used, care must be taken to avoid damaging the levator muscle, superior oblique muscle, trochlea, and lacrimal gland.</p>
				<p class="h3">Transcutaneous incisions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A well-&#173;hidden incision in the upper eyelid crease provides access to the superior orbital space (Fig&#160;7-3A) and offers better cosmesis than an incision placed directly over the superior orbital rim (Fig&#160;7-3B). Both the subperiosteal potential space and the extraconal space may be approached through this incision. To reach the subperiosteal space, dissection is performed superiorly &#173;toward the orbital rim in a plane between the orbicularis oculi muscle and the orbital septum. An incision is then made at the arcus marginalis, where the periosteum of the frontal bone reflects to become the orbital septum, thus entering the subperiosteal space. To access the superior extraconal space, the orbital septum is divided &#173;after dissection through the skin and orbicularis muscle.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The upper eyelid crease incision may also be used for entry into the medial intraconal space. &#173;After opening the orbital septum, the surgeon identifies the medial edge of the levator muscle. Dissection is kept medial to the levator and proceeds between the medial and central fat pads, through the intermuscular septum that extends from the superior rectus muscle to the medial rectus muscle. This approach may be used for biopsy of the optic nerve, for optic nerve sheath fenestration in cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or for accessing intraconal lesions medial or superior to the optic nerve.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The coronal approach to the superior orbit is most often used for skull-&#173;base tumor resections, trauma, or craniofacial surgery (Fig&#160;7-3C). This approach is commonly employed in a multidisciplinary approach for transcranial orbitotomies to provide better access to orbital apex tumors, orbital tumors with intracranial extension, and skull-&#173;base tumors with orbital involvement.</p>
				<p class="h3">Transconjunctival incisions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incisions in the superior conjunctiva can be used to reach the superomedial, sub-&#173;Tenon, intraconal, or extraconal surgical spaces (Fig 7-3D). Dissection must be performed medial to the levator muscle to prevent postoperative blepharoptosis. Care should also be taken in the superolateral fornix to avoid damage to the lacrimal ductules.</p>
				<p class="h3">Vertical eyelid splitting</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vertical splitting of the upper eyelid via a full-&#173;thickness incision allows an extended transconjunctival exposure for the removal of superomedial intraconal tumors (Fig&#160;7-3E). Careful realignment of the tarsal plate and levator aponeurosis, similar to traumatic laceration repair, prevents postoperative blepharoptosis, eyelid notching, and eyelid retraction.</p>
				<p class="h2">Inferior Approach</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inferior approach is useful for accessing masses that are vis&#173;i&#173;ble or palpable in the inferior conjunctival fornix of the lower eyelid as well as for deeper inferior extraconal or intraconal orbital masses. This approach is also commonly used to approach the orbital floor for fracture repair or decompression surgery.</p>
				<p class="h3">Transcutaneous incisions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vis&#173;i&#173;ble scarring can be minimized by use of a subciliary incision in the lower eyelid skin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-4">Fig&#160;7-4</span>). The orbital septum is exposed through the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle &#173;toward the inferior orbital rim. A cutaneous incision in the lower eyelid crease or directly over the inferior orbital rim can provide similar access but may leave a more noticeable scar and result in eyelid retraction. Once the skin–&#173;muscle flap is created, the surgeon can open the septum to expose the extraconal surgical space. Alternatively, for access to the inferior subperiosteal space, the periosteum is incised and elevated at the arcus marginalis to expose the orbital floor. Fractures of the orbital floor and access for orbital decompression surgery are reached by the subperiosteal route.</p>
				<p class="h3">Transconjunctival incisions</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For access to tumors and fractures of the inferior and medial orbit, the transconjunctival approach (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-5">Fig&#160;7-5</span>) has largely replaced the transcutaneous approach. The exposure and working space can be enlarged via a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis. An incision is made through the inferior conjunctiva and lower eyelid retractors to reach the extraconal surgical space and the orbital floor. This incision is placed &#173;either in the conjunctival fornix or just below the inferior tarsal border, and the conjunctiva is placed on superior traction. When using cutting cautery, the surgeon should take care to avoid causing thermal damage to the conjunctiva and tarsus. Caution should also be taken to avoid injuring the inferior oblique muscle, inferior rectus muscle, and infraorbital neurovascular bundle. Dissection is performed in a similar fashion in a preseptal plane, inferiorly &#173;toward the orbital rim. The extraconal space can be accessed by incising the orbital septum, and the subperiosteal space can be accessed by incising at the arcus marginalis and elevating the periosteum. Further dissection between the inferior rectus and lateral rectus muscles enables access to the intraconal space.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Alternatively, an incision of the bulbar conjunctiva and Tenon capsule allows entry to the sub-&#173;Tenon surgical space. This approach is also used to gain access to the intraconal surgical space by retracting or reflecting the inferior rectus muscle from the globe.</p>
				<p class="h2">Medial Approach</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approach to the medial orbit is used in several circumstances, including repair of medial wall trauma, orbital decompression, optic nerve sheath fenestrations, and access to lacrimal sac or sino-&#173;nasal tumors with orbital involvement. When dissecting in the medial orbit, the surgeon should take care to avoid damaging the medial canthal tendon, lacrimal canaliculi and sac, trochlea, superior oblique tendon and muscle, inferior oblique muscle, and the supratrochlear, infratrochlear, and supraorbital sensory nerves and vessels along the medial aspect of the superior orbital rim.</p>
				<p class="h3">Transcutaneous incision</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors within or near the lacrimal sac or the frontal or ethmoid sinuses can be approached through a frontoethmoidal skin incision placed vertically, just medial to the insertion of the medial canthal tendon. This route is generally used to enter the subperiosteal space by reflecting the medial canthal tendon in conjunction with the periosteum, thus preserving the lacrimal drainage apparatus. Incisions commonly used for external dacryocystorhinostomy also may be used to offer access to the lacrimal drainage apparatus and inferomedial orbit.</p>
				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Transconjunctival incision</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An incision in the bulbar conjunctiva allows entry into the extraconal or sub-&#173;Tenon surgical space (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-6">Fig&#160;7-6A</span>). If the medial rectus muscle is detached, the intraconal surgical space can be entered in the region of the anterior optic nerve for exploration or biopsy (Video&#160;7-1). If the posterior optic nerve or muscle cone needs to be accessed, a combined lateral/medial orbitotomy can be performed. A lateral orbitotomy with removal of the lateral orbital wall allows the globe to be displaced temporally, maximizing medial exposure to the deeper orbit.</p>

				<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Retrocaruncular incision</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This incision may be used for repair of medial wall fractures, for medial orbital bone decompression, and for drainage of medial subperiosteal abscesses. An incision between the caruncle and plica semilunaris allows excellent exposure of the medial orbit (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-6">Fig&#160;7-6B</span>). Blunt dissection is carried out medially, with dissection aimed &#173;toward the posterior lacrimal crest, and followed by incision and elevation of the periosteum to gain access to the subperiosteal space. In addition, by combining the retrocaruncular incision with an inferior transconjunctival incision, panoramic exposure of the inferior and medial orbit is pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The inferior oblique muscle may be divided at its origin along the inferomedial orbit rim and reattached at the end of surgery (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-7">Fig&#160;7-7</span>). This approach also provides better cosmesis than the traditional frontoethmoidal incision. However, to protect the canaliculi, care must be taken to remain posterior to the lacrimal drainage apparatus during dissection.</p>
				<p class="h2">Lateral Approach</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lateral approach to the orbit is used when a lesion is located within the lateral extraconal or intraconal space, &#173;behind the equator of the globe, or in the fossa of the lacrimal gland. In some cases, bone removal is required for greater access to larger pathological pro&#173;cesses or the orbital apex. &#173;Because the orbit is relatively shallower in &#173;children than in adults, extensive exposure may be achieved in pediatric patients without the need for bone removal.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The traditional subbrow curvilinear incision (see <span class="xref-figure-local xref-figure" id="Fig 7-2">Fig&#160;7-2</span>), which extends along the zygomatic arch, allows good exposure of the lateral rim but leaves a noticeable scar. It has largely been replaced by approaches through &#173;either an upper eyelid crease incision or an extended lateral canthotomy incision (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-8">Fig&#160;7-8</span>). With an upper eyelid crease approach, dissection is performed through the skin and orbicularis muscle, and the space between the orbicularis muscle and the septum is followed to the arcus marginalis. &#173;After an incision is made in the arcus marginalis, dissection can proceed into the subperiosteal space. Dissecting through the periorbita and then the intermuscular septum, &#173;either above or below the lateral rectus muscle and posterior to the equator of the globe, provides access to the intraconal retrobulbar space. If a lesion cannot be adequately exposed through a soft tissue lateral incision, bone removal may be required. Dissection is performed on the outside of the orbit to reflect the temporalis muscle. An oscillating saw or piezoelectric bone-&#173;cutting device is used to remove the bone of the lateral rim to provide further access (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-9">Fig&#160;7-9</span>). This procedure is also known as a marginotomy.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Complete hemostasis is achieved before closure. To help prevent postoperative intraorbital hemorrhage, an external drain may be placed in the deep orbit. The lateral orbital rim is usually repositioned and sutured back into place through predrilled tunnels. Alternatively, rigid fixation with a microplating system can be employed.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Orbital Decompression</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital decompression is a surgical procedure used to improve the volume-&#173;to-&#173;space discrepancy that occurs primarily in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED). The goal of orbital decompression is to allow the enlarged muscles and orbital fat to expand into the additional space that is created during the surgery (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-10">Fig&#160;7-10</span>). This expansion relieves pressure on the optic nerve and its blood supply; it also reduces proptosis and orbital congestion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Historically, decompression included removal of the medial orbital wall and much of the orbital floor, including the maxillo-&#173;ethmoidal strut, allowing the orbital tissues to expand into the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. The approach was made through a maxillary vestibular or transcutaneous incision. However, hypoglobus and upper eyelid retraction could be exacerbated postoperatively, especially in patients with large, restricted inferior rectus muscles. This type of decompression could also disrupt globe excursion due to prolapse of the muscles into the sinus space and displacement of the orbital contents.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The approach currently used by many orbital surgeons combines 1 or more discrete incisions that allow access to the lateral, inferior, and/or medial walls. Entry to the lateral and inferior orbit is provided by an upper eyelid crease incision, an extended lateral canthotomy incision, or an inferior transconjunctival incision combined with a lateral canthotomy/inferior cantholysis. Decompression of the lateral wall can be achieved by using rongeurs, a drill, or a piezoelectric bone removal device on the greater wing of the sphenoid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-11">Fig&#160;7-11</span>). A retrocaruncular incision allows an excellent approach to the medial orbital wall; it can be used in conjunction with a transconjunctival incision for further access. Alternatively, a transnasal endoscopic approach to the medial orbit via the ethmoid sinus may be used to access the medial wall.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Individualized surgical plans depend on patient variation in orbital bone size, the target for reduction in proptosis, and the surgeon’s preferred method of bone removal. Some surgeons choose to decompress the orbit in a “balanced” manner by removing bone from opposing walls, believing this &#173;will reduce the risk of worsened or new-&#173;onset diplopia (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-12">Fig&#160;7-12</span>). Additional deep orbital fat removal can be performed in patients with significant fat hypertrophy. For further decompression, occasionally some surgeons &#173;will remove the lateral orbital rim and/or reposition it anteriorly at the time of closure. Anterior displacement of the lateral canthus may also aid in the reduction of eyelid retraction. Orbital roof decompression into the anterior cranial fossa with neurosurgical approaches is generally not performed for TED.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Traditionally, orbital decompression for compressive optic neuropathy involves expansion of the medial orbital wall and optic strut; this can be accomplished through retrocaruncular or endoscopic approaches. Some studies have shown improvement with deep lateral wall decompression and fat decompression.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-5">Rootman&#160;DB. Orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease. <span class="reference_italic">Surv Ophthalmol.</span> 2018;63(1):86–104.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Postoperative Care for Orbital Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mea&#173;sures used to reduce postoperative edema include elevation of the head, cold compresses on the eyelids, administration of systemic corticosteroids, and optional placement of a drain. Ice packs minimize swelling and allow for observation of the operative site and monitoring of visual acuity. The patient is instructed to promptly contact the surgeon to report any change of vision. Recent studies suggest that postoperative antibiotics may not be needed in most patients undergoing orbital surgery.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-5">Fay&#160;A, Nallasamy&#160;N, Allen&#160;RC, Orbital Society, et&#160;al. Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics in 1,250 orbital surgeries. <span class="reference_italic">Ophth Plast Surg.</span> 2020;36(4):385–389.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Special Surgical Techniques in the Orbit</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) may have value in selected cases, including lymphoid lesions, secondary tumors invading the orbit from the sinuses, suspected metastatic tumors, and blind eyes with optic nerve tumors (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 7-13">Fig&#160;7-13</span>). This technique is not very effective for obtaining tissue from fibrous inflammatory lesions &#173;because of the difficulty in successfully aspirating cells. Although historically FNAB has not been considered effective for biopsy in lymphoproliferative disorders, technological advances have improved its diagnostic yield when it is used in combination with flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies or polymerase chain reaction analy&#173;sis. If necessary, imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography, can be used to help guide the needle into the tumor. Cells (and occasionally a small block of tissue) are aspirated from the lesion. A skilled cytologist is required to study the specimen. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of FNAB.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the anatomic relationship of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses to the medial and inferior orbit, respectively, endoscopic transnasal surgery may be considered. Endoscopic approaches through the sinus may be considered in collaboration with head and neck surgeons. Such an approach may permit biopsy and/or resection of some orbital pathology. It may also be combined with open orbitotomy to allow improved access to apical pro&#173;cesses. In addition, decompression of the orbit or optic canal may be considered for patients with TED or nontraumatic compressive optic neuropathy. Such an approach can also be used for drainage of medial subperiosteal orbital abscesses in patients with sinusitis or for debridement of necrotic tissue in patients with fungal orbital cellulitis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Tumors and traumatic injuries of the skull base may involve the superior and posterior orbit. Advanced surgical techniques allow access to &#173;these areas via a frontal craniotomy or frontotemporal-&#173;orbitozygomatic (FTOZ) approach with a multidisciplinary team. The neurosurgeon provides the orbital surgeon with access to the deep superior and lateral orbit by removing the superior orbital rim and orbital roof. &#173;These techniques enable decompression of the optic canal as well as resection of tumors such as meningiomas, fibrous dysplasia, cavernous venous malformations, solitary fibrous tumors, schwannomas, and gliomas. Transorbital neuroendoscopic surgery (TONES) has gained popularity for utilizing standard orbital surgical approaches to provide access for neurosurgical procedures. Orbital bone removal, especially in the lateral wall and roof, allow for resection of anterior-&#173; and &#173;middle cranial fossa pathology. Rather than standard craniotomies, &#173;these less invasive approaches can lead to less morbidity and quicker recovery.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Complications of Orbital Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgeon can reduce complications from orbital surgery by performing a complete preoperative evaluation with orbital imaging when indicated, choosing the appropriate surgical approach, obtaining adequate exposure, manipulating the tissues carefully, employing proper instrumentation and illumination, maintaining excellent hemostasis, and using a team approach when appropriate.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Decreased or lost vision is a serious complication of surgery that may be caused by excessive traction on the globe and optic nerve, contusion of the optic nerve, postoperative infection, or hemorrhage. Orbital hemorrhage may lead to increased orbital pressure and consequent ischemic injury to the optic nerve. A patient who has severe orbital pain postoperatively should be evaluated immediately for pos&#173;si&#173;ble orbital hemorrhage. If this pain is associated with decreased vision, proptosis, ecchymosis, increased intraocular pressure, and an afferent pupillary defect, the surgeon should consider opening the wound to minimize the effects of orbital compartment syndrome (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>&#160;in this volume), evacuating any hematoma, controlling active bleeding, and employing hemostatic agents.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In addition to vision loss, pos&#173;si&#173;ble complications &#173;after orbital surgery include:</p>
