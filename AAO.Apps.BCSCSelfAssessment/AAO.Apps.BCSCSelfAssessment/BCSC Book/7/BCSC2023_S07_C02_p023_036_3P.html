			<p class="h1">History</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The history of pre&#173;sent illness establishes a probable diagnosis and guides the initial workup and therapy. It should include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">onset, course, and duration of symptoms (eg, pain, altered sensation, diplopia, changes in vision) and associated signs (eg, erythema, palpable mass, globe displacement)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior disease (eg, thyroid eye disease, sinus disease) and therapy</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">injury (eg, head or facial trauma)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">systemic conditions (eg, autoimmune disease, cancer, immunosuppression, thyroid dysfunction)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;family history</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior photo&#173;graphs of the patient to establish a timeline of the pro&#173;cess</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h2">Pain</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pain may be a symptom of an inflammatory or infectious pro&#173;cess, orbital hemorrhage, malignant lacrimal gland tumors, invasion by a sinonasal carcinoma, or metastatic lesions.</p>
				<p class="h2">Progression</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rate of progression can be a helpful diagnostic indicator. Conditions with onset occurring over days to weeks include nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI), scleritis, myositis, dacryoadenitis, orbital cellulitis, hemorrhage, thrombophlebitis, fulminant neoplasia (eg,&#160;rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma), and metastatic tumors. Conditions with onset occurring over months to years include dermoid cyst, pleomorphic adenoma of the lacrimal gland, neurogenic tumor, cavernous venous malformation, lymphoma, solitary fibrous tumor, fibrous dysplasia, and osteoma.</p>
				<p class="h2">Periorbital Changes</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Periorbital changes may provide clues to under&#173;lying disorders. For example, ecchymosis of the eyelid skin may be a sign of metastatic neuroblastoma (<span class="xref-figure"id="Fig 2-1">Fig&#160;2-1</span>), leukemia, or amyloidosis. <span class="xref-table" id="Table 2-1">&#173;Table&#160;2-1</span> lists vari&#173;ous periorbital signs and their common &#173;causes.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Physical Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Special attention should be given to the assessment of visual acuity, pupillary responses, color vision, visual fields, ocular motility, globe position, and the fundus. Diagnostic and imaging studies are often required in addition to the basic workup. Globe displacement is the most common clinical manifestation of an orbital abnormality.</p>
				<p class="h2">Inspection</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several terms are used to describe the position of the eye and orbit. <span class="italic">Proptosis</span> or <span class="italic">exophthalmos</span> denotes a forward displacement or protrusion of the globe. <span class="italic">Exorbitism</span> refers to an &#173;angle between the lateral orbital walls that is greater than 90°, which may also be associated with shallow orbital depth. This condition contrasts with <span class="italic">hypertelorism,</span> or <span class="italic">telorbitism,</span> which refers to a wider-&#173;than-&#173;normal separation between the medial orbital walls. Generally, exorbitism and hypertelorism are congenital or traumatic abnormalities. <span class="italic">Telecanthus</span> denotes an abnormal increased distance between the medial canthi. The eye may also be displaced vertically (<span class="italic">hyperglobus</span> or <span class="italic">hypoglobus</span>) or horizontally by an orbital mass. Retrodisplacement of the eye into the orbit, called <span class="italic">enophthalmos,</span> may occur &#173;because of volume expansion of the orbit (eg, due to fracture or &#173;silent sinus syndrome; see Fig&#160;5-26), in association with orbital varix, or secondary to sclerosing orbital tumors (eg, metastatic breast carcinoma; see Fig&#160;5-30).</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Because the globe is usually displaced away from the site of a mass, proptosis often indicates the location of that mass. Axial displacement is usually indicative of an intraconal mass &#173;behind the globe; such lesions include cavernous venous malformation, optic nerve glioma, primary optic nerve sheath meningioma, metastasis, and arteriovenous malformation (see Chapter&#160;5). Nonaxial displacement is caused by lesions with a prominent component outside the muscle cone. Superior displacement is produced by maxillary sinus tumors invading the orbital floor and pushing the globe upward. Inferomedial displacement can result from orbital dermoid cysts and lacrimal gland tumors. Inferolateral displacement can result from frontoethmoidal mucoceles, abscesses, osteomas, and ethmoid sinus carcinomas.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In adults, bilateral proptosis is most often caused by thyroid eye disease (TED); however, other disorders can also produce bilateral proptosis, including lymphoma, vasculitis, NSOI, metastatic tumors, carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and leukemic infiltrates (see Chapters&#160;4 and 5). TED is also the most common cause of unilateral proptosis in adults. In &#173;children with bilateral proptosis, the clinician should consider TED, NSOI, metastatic neuroblastoma, and leukemic infiltrates. Unilateral proptosis in &#173;children should raise concern for orbital cellulitis, vascular malformation, and malignancy.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Exophthalmometry is a mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the anterior–&#173;posterior position of the globe, generally from the lateral orbital rim to the anterior corneal surface (Hertel exophthalmometry, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-2">Fig&#160;2-2A</span>). The Naugle exophthalmometer uses the frontal and maxillary bones as its reference structures (Fig&#160;2-2B); this exophthalmometer is useful in trauma patients when the lateral orbital rim has been displaced or in patients who have had the lateral orbital rim removed as part of orbital surgery.</p>
				<p class="body-text">In the absence of disease, globe position varies by age, sex, and race. Mean values are referenced in Black (men: 18.5 mm; women: 17.8 mm) and White (men: 16.5&#160;mm; &#173;women: 15.4&#160;mm) populations in the United States. More recent studies have characterized &#173;these mea&#173;sure&#173;ments in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar racial and ethnic groups, including in Hong Kong Chinese (men: 15.3&#160;mm; &#173;women: 14.4&#160;mm), Ira&#173;ni&#173;ans (men: 16.5&#160;mm; &#173;women: 16.2&#160;mm), Sinhalese (men: 16.6&#160;mm; &#173;women: 15.3&#160;mm), Tamils (men: 16.7&#160;mm; &#173;women: 15.0&#160;mm), and Turks (men: 16.1&#160;mm; &#173;women: 15.5&#160;mm), among other populations. Asymmetry of greater than 2&#160;mm between an individual patient’s eyes suggests proptosis or enophthalmos. &#173;These conditions may best be appreciated clinically when the examiner looks up from below, while the patient’s head is tilted back; this perspective is called the <span class="italic">submentovertex</span>, <span class="italic">&#173;Waters view,</span> or <span class="italic">worm’s-&#173;eye view</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-3">Fig&#160;2-3</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pseudoproptosis</span> is the simulation of abnormal prominence of the eye or a true asymmetry that is not the result of increased orbital contents. This diagnosis should be reserved &#173;until an orbital lesion has been ruled out. &#173;Causes of pseudoproptosis include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">enlarged globe or irregular cornea (eg, axial myopia, buphthalmos, staphyloma, keratoconus)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">contralateral enophthalmos (caused by prior orbital trauma, surgery, &#173;silent sinus syndrome)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">asymmetric orbital size</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">asymmetric palpebral fissures (usually caused by ipsilateral eyelid retraction, facial nerve paralysis, or contralateral blepharoptosis)</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">congenital deformity (microphthalmia)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text">Ocular movements may be restricted in a specific direction of gaze by neoplasm or inflammation. In&#160;TED, the inferior rectus is the muscle most commonly affected, resulting in restriction of upgaze and pos&#173;si&#173;ble hypotropia in primary gaze. A large or rapidly enlarging orbital mass can also impede ocular movements, even in the absence of direct muscle invasion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Eyelid abnormalities are common in TED. The <span class="italic">von Graefe sign</span> is a delay in the upper eyelid’s descent (eyelid lag) during downgaze and is highly suggestive of TED. In fact, eyelid lag and retraction of the upper and/or lower eyelids are the most common physical signs of TED (see Chapter&#160;4).</p>
				<p class="h2">Palpation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Palpation around the globe may reveal the presence of a mass in the anterior orbit, especially if the lacrimal gland is enlarged. Increased re&#173;sis&#173;tance to retrodisplacement of the globe is a nonspecific abnormality that may result &#173;either from a retrobulbar tumor or from diffuse inflammation such as that seen in TED. The physician should also palpate regional lymph nodes.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis for a palpable mass in the superonasal quadrant may include mucocele, mucopyocele, encephalocele, neurofibroma, dermoid cyst, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and amyloid. A palpable mass in the superotemporal quadrant may be a prolapsed lacrimal gland, a dermoid cyst, a lacrimal gland tumor, lymphoma, and NSOI.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Pulsation of the eye is caused by transmission of the vascular pulse through the orbit. This may result from &#173;either abnormal vascular flow or transmission of normal intracranial pulsations through a bony defect in the orbital walls. Abnormal vascular flow may be caused by arteriovenous communications, such as carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas. Defects in the bony orbital walls may result from sinus mucoceles, surgical removal of bone, trauma, and developmental abnormalities, including encephalocele, meningocele, and sphenoid wing dysplasia associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>

			<p class="h1">Primary Studies</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the primary studies for evaluation of orbital disorders. Ultrasonography (echography) may also be helpful for some disorders.</p>
				<p class="h2">Computed Tomography</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CT is the most valuable technique for delineating the shape, location, extent, and character of an orbital pro&#173;cess (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-4">Fig&#160;2-4</span>). CT helps refine the differential diagnosis, and when orbitotomy is indicated, it helps guide the surgical approach by demonstrating the relationship of the lesion to the surgical space or spaces of the orbit (see Fig&#160;7-1). The resolution and soft-&#173;tissue contrast of CT are adequate for visualizing nearly all pathologic pro&#173;cesses in the orbit, and the bony resolution is superior to that provided by any other modality, making CT the imaging technique of choice for orbital trauma and bony tumors. Orbital CT scans are usually obtained in sections of 2–3&#160;mm. For greater detail, fine cuts at 1.0-mm intervals may be requested.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The visualization of tumors that are highly vascular (eg, meningiomas) or that have altered vascular permeability is improved with use of intravenous contrast-&#173;enhancing agents. Contrast is also helpful to identify an orbital abscess. The resolution and tissue-&#173;contrast capabilities of CT allow imaging not only of bone but also of soft tissue and foreign bodies. By selecting a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar win&#173;dow type (eg, bone, soft tissue), the CT image gray scale may be manipulated to highlight specific structures.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Orbital images can be obtained in the <span class="italic">axial plane,</span> parallel to the course of the optic nerve; in the <span class="italic">coronal plane,</span> which shows the eye, optic nerve, and extraocular muscles in cross section; or in the <span class="italic">sagittal plane,</span> parallel to the nasal septum. CT scanners use software to reconstruct (reformat) any section in any direction (axial, coronal, or sagittal). <span class="italic">Direct coronal scans</span> are ideal for evaluation of the optic nerve and extraocular muscles as well as the bony roof and floor of the orbit. <span class="italic">Three-&#173;dimensional CT</span> allows reformatting of CT information into 3-&#173;dimensional projections of the bony orbital walls (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-5">Fig&#160;2-5</span>). &#173;Because this type of imaging requires thin sections and additional computer time, it is typically reserved for use in preparation for craniofacial surgery or repairs of complex orbital fractures.</p>
				<p class="h2">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique that does not employ ionizing radiation and has no known adverse biological effects (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-6">Fig&#160;2-6</span>). MRI is based on the interaction of 3 physical components: atomic nuclei, which possess an electrical charge; radiofrequency (RF) waves; and a power&#173;ful magnetic field.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Each orbital tissue has specific magnetic resonance (MR) par&#173;ameters that provide the information used to generate an image. &#173;These par&#173;ameters include a tissue’s proton density and relaxation times. <span class="italic">Proton density</span> is determined by the number of protons per unit volume of tissue. Each tissue has dif&#173;fer&#173;ent proton density and T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (transverse relaxation time) characteristics, which provide the image the contrast necessary to differentiate tissues. Healthy tissue can have imaging characteristics dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from &#173;those of diseased tissue, a good example being the bright signal associated with tissue edema seen on T2-&#173;weighted scans.</p>
				<p class="body-text">MRI is usually performed with images created from both T1 and T2 par&#173;ameters. T1-&#173;weighted images generally offer the best anatomical detail of the orbit. T2-&#173;weighted images have the advantage of demonstrating methemoglobin as brighter than melanin, whereas &#173;these substances have the same signal intensity on T1-&#173;weighted images. The difference in brightness seen on T2-&#173;weighted images can be helpful in differentiating melanotic lesions from hemorrhagic pro&#173;cesses. <span class="italic">Gadolinium,</span> a paramagnetic contrast agent given intravenously, allows enhancement of vascularized lesions so that they exhibit the same density as fat. It also enhances lesions that have abnormal vascular permeability. Special MR sequences have been developed to suppress the normal bright signal of fat on T1-&#173;weighted images (“fat suppression”; see Fig&#160;2-6) and the bright signal of cerebrospinal fluid on T2-&#173;weighted images (fluid-&#173;attenuated inversion recovery, or FLAIR). <span class="italic">Gradient echo sequences</span> may reveal hemorrhage in vascular malformations that might be missed on T1-&#173; and T2-&#173;weighted images. <span class="italic">Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences</span> may assist in the assessment of local tissue perfusion, such as optic nerve infarction, or in distinguishing dif&#173;fer&#173;ent orbital lesions.</p>

				<p class="h2">Comparison of CT and MRI</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although both CT and MRI are impor&#173;tant modalities for the detection and characterization of orbital and ocular diseases, CT is currently the primary and most useful orbital imaging technique. Compared with MRI, it is faster, less expensive, and less sensitive to motion artifact. In general, CT provides better spatial resolution (differentiation between 2 objects near each other), allowing precise localization of a lesion. MRI generally provides better tissue contrast than CT; however, in most orbital disorders, the orbital fat provides sufficient natu&#173;ral tissue contrast to readily allow visualization of orbital tumors on CT. Each of the techniques has advantages in specific situations, some of which are discussed in the following text and in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 2-2">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span>.</p>
				<p class="body-text">MRI offers advantages over CT in some situations. It allows the direct display of anatomical information in multiple planes (sagittal, axial, coronal, and any oblique plane). In addition, MRI provides better soft-&#173;tissue definition than does CT, a capability that is especially helpful in the evaluation of demyelination as well as vascular and hemorrhagic lesions (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-7">Fig&#160;2-7</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">MRI also provides better tissue contrast of structures in the orbital apex, including the intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve, structures in periorbital spaces, and orbitocranial tumors, &#173;because &#173;there is no artifact from the skull-&#173;base bones. Bone and calcification produce a low signal on MRI, and thus bony structures may be evaluated by visualization of the signal void left by the bone. However, this is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble when the bone is adjacent to structures and ele&#173;ments that also create a signal void, such as air, rapidly flowing blood, calcification, and dura mater. Thus, CT is superior to MRI for the evaluation of fractures, bone destruction, hyperostosis, and tissue calcification.</p>
				<p class="body-text">MRI is contraindicated in patients who have ferromagnetic metallic foreign bodies in the orbit or periorbital soft tissue. Special considerations need also to be made in the presence of ferromagnetic vascular clips, magnetic intravascular filters, or electronic devices in the body such as cardiac pacemakers or deep brain stimulators. A history of prior procedural or surgical intervention should be elicited, and if necessary, the presence of such foreign material can be ruled out with plain film x-&#173;ray or CT. Certain types of eye makeup can produce artifacts and should be removed prior to MRI. Dental amalgam is not a ferromagnetic substance and is not a contraindication to MRI, but this material produces artifacts and degrades the images on both MRI and CT. Titanium is paramagnetic, and thus patients with orbital, facial, or cranial hardware may safely have an MRI.&#160;Similarly, implanted eyelid weights composed of pure gold, pure platinum, or platinum/iridium alloy are MRI compatible with a magnetic field strength up to 7.0 Tesla.</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Because CT and MRI yield dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types of images, it is not unusual for both techniques to be employed in the evaluation of complex orbital disorders. The use of &#173;these modalities should be based on the patient’s specific condition. In general, MRI is the better primary technique for imaging the orbitocranial junction and brain; however, CT scanning may enhance the assessment by providing superior bone visualization.</p>
				<p class="body-text">CT imaging should be obtained judiciously in &#173;children, as they are much more radiosensitive than adults. Extrapolation of lifetime risk of malignancy development in atomic bomb survivors led to a consensus statement from the American Acad&#173;emy of Pediatrics that low-&#173;level radiation may carry a small risk of cancer. When pos&#173;si&#173;ble, MRI should be considered as the study of choice for &#173;children, with CT reserved for select clinical scenarios.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--first">Leung&#160;RS. Radiation protection of the child from diagnostic imaging. <span class="italic">Curr Pediatr Rev</span>. 2015;11(4):235–242.</p>
				<p class="h2">Stereotactic Navigation</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of computer-&#173;assisted 3-&#173;dimensional navigation (image guidance) is increasingly common in clinical practice (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-8">Fig&#160;2-8</span>). Stereotactic guidance can be useful for complex multidisciplinary surgical procedures in which orbital lesions are accessed through craniotomy and endoscopic skull-&#173;base approaches. However, in uncomplicated orbital surgery, while image guidance may have some utility for surgical training, it has a lesser role in procedures performed by experienced orbital surgeons.</p>
				<p class="h2">Ultrasonography</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital ultrasonography may be used to examine patients with orbital disorders. The size, shape, and position of normal and abnormal orbital tissues can be determined by means of con&#173;temporary ultrasound techniques. B-&#173;scan ultrasonography captures 2-&#173;dimensional images of &#173;these tissues, while standardized A-&#173;scan ultrasonography provides 1-&#173;dimensional images rendered as a series of spikes of varying height and width that demonstrate the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar echogenic characteristics of each tissue. Areas of edema can sometimes be used to discern the degree of disease activity; ultrasonography has high resolution in the area of the sclera and optic nerve insertion and is useful for evaluating scleritis and other types of anterior inflammation that produce fluid in the sub-&#173;Tenon space. Localization of foreign bodies is pos&#173;si&#173;ble with ultrasonography. <span class="italic">Doppler ultrasonography</span> can provide specific information regarding blood flow and can demonstrate arterialization, retrograde flow in the orbital veins in cases of dural cavernous fistula or arteriovenous malformation, and vascular abnormalities associated with increased blood flow. Vascular tumors can be identified by active pulsation or, in the case of venous lesions, by compressibility and change in size with the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Ultrasound analy&#173;sis of orbital tissues and diseases requires specialized equipment and experienced personnel; office-&#173;based equipment is generally not suitable for this purpose. Moreover, ultrasonography is of &#173;limited value in assessing lesions of the posterior orbit (&#173;because of sound attenuation), the sinuses, or intracranial space (&#173;because sound does not pass well through air or bone).</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Secondary Studies</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary studies that are performed for specific indications include venography, arteriography, and stereotactic navigation. Although &#173;these studies are rarely used, they may be helpful in specific cases.</p>
				<p class="h2">Venography</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the advent of CT and MRI, orbital venography, in which contrast material is injected into the frontal or the angular vein to reveal a venous abnormality, was used in the diagnosis and management of orbital varices and in the study of the cavernous sinus. Subtraction and magnification techniques have been used to increase the resolution of venography. &#173;Because moving blood generates a signal void during MR imaging, larger venous abnormalities and structures can be visualized well on MR venography. Some orbitocranial vascular malformations and fistulas are best accessed directly via the superior ophthalmic vein, both for diagnosis and for pos&#173;si&#173;ble treatment.</p>
				<p class="h2">Arteriography</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Arteriography is the gold standard for diagnosis of an arterial lesion such as an aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and carotid-&#173;cavernous fistula. Retrograde catheterization of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral vessels is performed through the femoral artery. However, &#173;there is a small risk of serious neurologic and vascular complications (1%–2%) &#173;because the technique requires installation of a catheter and injection of radiopaque dye into the arterial system; thus, the test is reserved for patients with a high probability of having a lesion.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Visualization can be maximized with selective injection into the internal and external carotid arteries, magnification to allow viewing of the smaller-&#173;caliber vessels, and subtraction techniques to radiographically eliminate bone. An additional benefit of arteriography is the ability to si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously diagnose and embolize lesions with use of vari&#173;ous glues and coils.</p>
				<p class="h2">CT and MR&#160;Angiography</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of modern hardware and software has enabled precise CT and MR imaging for diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas without the expense, discomfort, and risks associated with the use of contrast agents and intravascular catheterization. <span class="italic">Time-&#173;resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS)</span> uses extremely rapid acquisition of MRIs to provide dynamic images of intravascular contrast flow and may assist in the evaluation of orbital vascular lesions. MR angiography is also useful for diagnosis of vascular compression of the facial nerve at the root exit zone that results in hemifacial spasm. However, MR angiography is less sensitive than direct catheter angiography for identifying carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas. When determining which test to use, the ophthalmologist may consult with a neuroradiologist to discuss the suspected lesion and to ensure se&#173;lection of the imaging modality best suited to the patient.</p>

			<p class="h1">Pathology</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top6">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of an orbital lesion usually requires analy&#173;sis of tissue obtained through an orbitotomy. Appropriate &#173;handling of the tissue specimen is necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Most tissue samples are placed in formalin for permanent section analy&#173;sis. Frozen section evaluation may be performed at the time of surgery, but it is generally not used for definitive diagnosis of an orbital tumor. However, when the area of proposed biopsy is not obvious, frozen sections are helpful to confirm that appropriate tissue has been obtained for permanent section analy&#173;sis. Frozen section analy&#173;sis is also used intraoperatively to determine tumor margins and ensure complete tumor removal. Tissue removed for frozen section analy&#173;sis should be placed in a dampened saline gauze and sent promptly for analy&#173;sis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Preoperative consultation with a pathologist familiar with orbital disease may be helpful to maximize the information gained from an orbital biopsy. In many cases, fresh tissue should be obtained for frozen section and cell-&#173;surface-&#173;marker studies. Cell-&#173;marker studies (flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry) are required in the analy&#173;sis of all orbital lymphoid lesions. &#173;These studies may allow differentiation between reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma. Such studies may also indicate the presence of estrogen receptors in cases of metastatic prostate or breast carcinoma and thus provide useful information about sensitivity to hormonal therapy. Marker studies are also helpful in the diagnosis of poorly differentiated tumors when light microscopy alone is not definitive.</p>
				<p class="body-text">All biopsy specimens must be treated delicately to minimize crush and cautery artifacts, which can limit interpretation. Permanent section tissue biopsy specimens should be placed in fixatives promptly. If fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy is planned, a cytologist or trained technician must be available to &#173;handle the aspirate (see Fig&#160;7-13). In special cases, the biopsy can be performed &#173;under &#173;either ultrasonographic or CT guidance. Although a fine-&#173;bore needle occasionally yields a sufficient cell block, the specimen is usually &#173;limited to cytologic study. Larger biopsy specimens, in which light and electron microscopy can be used to evaluate histologic patterns, may permit a more conclusive diagnosis.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Genomic analy&#173;sis of tumors is more frequently being performed; this modality has implications for disease prognosis and the use of targeted therapies.</p>

				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For suspected TED, screening for abnormal thyroid function commonly includes &#173;free T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> and thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone (TSH) tests. Results of &#173;these serum tests are abnormal in 90% of patients with TED.&#160;However, if the results are normal but thyroid disease is still strongly suspected, additional endocrine studies, such as of thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulins or TSH-&#173;receptor antibodies, can be considered, as &#173;these tests have greater sensitivity for detecting autoimmune thyroid disease.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; see Chapter&#160;4) should be considered in patients with sclerokeratitis or coexisting sinus and/or orbital disease. A useful test for GPA is the antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) serum assay, which demonstrates a cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-&#173;ANCA). It should be noted that studies have found the sensitivity of c-&#173;ANCA testing for isolated sino-&#173;orbital GPA to be significantly lower than in generalized GPA. Biopsy of affected tissues is often critical in establishing diagnosis and classically shows vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis, although necrotizing vasculitis is not always pre&#173;sent in orbital biopsies.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory condition that may pre&#173;sent with lacrimal gland enlargement, conjunctival granulomas, extraocular muscle or optic nerve infiltration, and/or solitary orbital granulomas. While testing with serum angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme may be helpful in the diagnosis of systemic sarcoid, investigations have demonstrated that ACE and lysozyme levels are often normal in isolated orbital disease. Diagnosis is thus facilitated with tissue biopsy.</p>
