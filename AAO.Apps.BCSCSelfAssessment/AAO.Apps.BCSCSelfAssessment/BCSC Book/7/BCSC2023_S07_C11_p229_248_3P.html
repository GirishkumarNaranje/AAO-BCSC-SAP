			<p class="h1">Eyelid Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid injuries can be classified as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma. The following cardinal rules apply to the management of both types of eyelid trauma:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">Apply detailed knowledge of eyelid and orbital anatomy.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Take a careful history.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Rec&#173;ord the best visual acuity for each eye.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Thoroughly evaluate the globe and orbit.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Obtain appropriate radiologic studies.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Perform the best pos&#173;si&#173;ble primary repair.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="h2">Blunt Trauma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ecchymosis and edema are the most common presenting signs of blunt eyelid trauma. A thorough slit-&#173;lamp evaluation and dilated fundus examination should be performed to identify intraocular injury. Computed tomography may be indicated to assess for orbital fracture. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span> for further discussion of orbital fractures.</p>
				<p class="h2">Penetrating Trauma</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid laceration treatment depends on the depth and location of the injury. Detailed knowledge of eyelid anatomy is required to optimize the initial repair and reduce the need for secondary repairs.</p>
				<p class="h3">Lacerations not involving the eyelid margin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superficial eyelid lacerations involving only the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle usually require only skin sutures, with or without buried subcutaneous sutures. Unnecessary scarring can be prevented by following the basic princi&#173;ples of repair, including conservative wound debridement, use of small-&#173;caliber sutures, wound-&#173;edge eversion, and early suture removal.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The presence of orbital fat in the wound indicates that the orbital septum has been &#173;violated (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-1">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). Prior to repair, any foreign bodies in the wound should be identified and removed, and the wound should be properly irrigated. Orbital fat prolapse in an upper eyelid wound is an indication for exploration of the levator muscle and aponeurosis. If the levator muscle or aponeurosis is lacerated, repair may be required to restore normal function. Upper eyelid retraction and tethering to the superior orbital rim are common when the orbital septum or levator is inadvertently incorporated into the repair. Orbital septum lacerations do not require repair; suturing the septum can lead to vertical shortening of the septum and result in eyelid retraction.</p>
				<p class="h3">Lacerations involving the eyelid margin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When margin-&#173;involving eyelid lacerations are repaired, vari&#173;ous techniques can be used to prevent notching of the margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-2">Figs&#160;11-2</span>, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-3">11-3</span>). Eyelid margin reapproximation is performed using interrupted or vertical mattress sutures to align the eyelash line, gray line, and mucocutaneous junction. &#173;These sutures are tied to cause slight eversion of the wound edges, allowing for wound contraction during healing. The nonmarginal cut edges of the tarsus are reapproximated in a lamellar fashion (ie, partial-&#173;thickness sutures through the tarsus) to strengthen wound closure and prevent tarsal edge imbrication and corneal abrasion. Suture tails are directed away from the ocular surface to prevent corneal irritation. Silk sutures can be used if the patient is amenable to postoperative suture removal in the clinic; other&#173;wise, resorbable, buried vertical mattress sutures can be used.</p>
				<p class="h3">Trauma involving the canthal soft tissue</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trauma to the medial or lateral canthal areas usually results from horizontal traction on the eyelid, which &#173;causes avulsion at the eyelid’s weakest points, the medial or lateral canthal tendon. The medial canthal area and lacrimal drainage apparatus should be carefully evaluated for injury, and suspected canalicular injury should be confirmed by inspection, gentle probing, and irrigation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-4">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). Canalicular lacerations are discussed in detail in Chapter&#160;15.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The integrity of the inferior and superior limbs of the medial and lateral canthal tendons can be assessed by grasping each eyelid with toothed forceps and tugging away from the injury while palpating the insertion of the tendon. Medial canthal tendon avulsion should be suspected when rounding of the medial canthal &#173;angle and acquired telecanthus are observed. The optimal treatment approach depends on the extent of medial canthal tendon avulsion. Attention to the posterior tendinous attachment to the posterior lacrimal crest is critical. If the upper or lower limb is avulsed but the posterior attachment of the tendon is intact, the avulsed limb may be sutured to its stump or the periosteum overlying the anterior lacrimal crest. If the entire tendon, including the posterior portion, is avulsed but &#173;there is no naso-&#173;orbital fracture, the avulsed tendon may be wired through small drill holes in the ipsilateral posterior lacrimal crest. If the entire tendon is avulsed and &#173;there is a naso-&#173;orbital fracture, transnasal wiring or plating is necessary &#173;after fracture reduction. A T-&#173;shaped miniplate may be fixed anteriorly on the nasal bone, extending posteriorly into the orbit. The suture is sewn through the transected tendon and passed through holes in the miniplate. This technique is particularly helpful when the posterior lacrimal crest bone is absent.</p>
				<p class="h2">Secondary Repair</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary repair following eyelid trauma usually involves treating cicatricial changes due to the original trauma or revising a suboptimal primary surgical repair that has lead to ectropion, entropion, eyelid retraction, or lagophthalmos (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-5">Fig 11-5</span>). Scar revision may require a &#173;simple excision with primary closure or a more complex tissue rearrangement. The location of the scar in relation to the relaxed skin tension lines dictates the best technique, or combination of techniques, for scar revision. An elliptical scar excision is most useful for revising scars that follow the relaxed skin tension lines; single or multiple Z-&#173;plasty flap techniques can be used to revise scars that do not follow &#173;these lines.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Skin grafts, applied alone or in combination with vari&#173;ous flaps, are used when tissue has been lost or when lengthening of the anterior lamella is required to correct scar contracture. Although any non–&#173;hair-&#173;bearing skin can be used for eyelid reconstruction, the ideal donor tissue is full-&#173;thickness upper eyelid skin that can be harvested as if performing a skin-&#173;only blepharoplasty. Alternate donor tissue include the pre-&#173; or post-&#173;auricular skin, supraclavicular skin, and upper inner arm skin. The ideal skin graft should be similar in color and thickness to the recipient-&#173;site skin with minimal actinic damage.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Tarsoconjunctival flaps or grafts are good substitutes for repairing posterior lamella eyelid defects when both the tarsal plate and conjunctiva are deficient. Buccal mucosa may be used when only the conjunctiva is missing. Hard palate composite grafts can be used for posterior lamella tarsal defects in the lower eyelid but should be avoided in the upper eyelid &#173;because the keratinized epithelium of the graft may irritate the cornea.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Surgical repair for traumatic ptosis should be delayed for 3–6 months &#173;after injury to allow for spontaneous improvement, except in cases of amblyogenic ptosis in young &#173;children.</p>
				<p class="h2">Dog and &#173;Human Bites</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dog or &#173;human bites commonly result in tearing and crushing injuries, partial-&#173;thickness and full-&#173;thickness eyelid lacerations, canthal avulsions, and canalicular lacerations. Tissue loss is uncommon but may occur. Irrigation and early wound repair are preferred, and tetanus and rabies protocols should be observed. Systemic antibiotics are recommended for all bite wounds due to the high risk of infection, and amoxicillin-&#173;clavulanate is a good option for adults and &#173;children. Mixed organism flora specific to dog bites most often include <span class="italic">Pasteurella canis</span>, as well as aerobes (streptococci, staphylococci, <span class="italic">Moraxella, Neisseria</span>), and anaerobes <span class="italic">(Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas</span>)<span class="italic">.</span> Ocular, canalicular, and facial injuries are most commonly seen in &#173;children, often in association with dog bites from mixed breeds, German shepherds, Labrador retrievers, pit bull terriers, and rottweilers.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Prendes&#160;MA, Jian-&#173;Amadi&#160;A, Chang&#160;SH, Shaftel&#160;SS. Ocular trauma from dog bites: characterization, associations, and treatment patterns at a regional level I trauma center&#160;over 11&#160;years. <span class="reference-single_italic">Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg.</span> 2016;32(4):279–283.</p>
				<p class="h2">Burns</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Isolated burns of the eyelid are rare; eyelid burns are generally seen in patients who have sustained extensive burns on the face and body. &#173;These patients are often semiconscious or heavi&#173;ly sedated and require ocular surface protection to prevent corneal exposure, ulceration, and infection. Early treatment involves the use of lubricating antibiotic ointments and moisture chambers and frequent evaluation of the globes and eyelids. If cicatricial changes begin in the periocular region and are not aggressively treated, relentless and rapid deterioration of the patient’s ocular status often ensues due to cicatricial ectropion, lagophthalmos, and corneal exposure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-6">Fig&#160;11-6</span>). If used, tarsorrhaphies should be more extensive than seems immediately necessary to mitigate the risks of cicatricial traction and dehiscence. In the past, skin grafting and reconstruction &#173;were often delayed for months &#173;after injury &#173;until cicatricial changes stabilized, which usually led to multiple surgeries and suboptimal outcomes. However, early and aggressive intervention &#173;after skin epithelialization can improve wound healing. Intralesional injections of wound-&#173;modulating agents (eg, 5-&#173;fluorouracil, triamcinolone) into the scar and fractional ablative &#173;laser resurfacing can be very effective in treating and preventing cicatricial ectropion, contracture, and hypertrophic scarring. &#173;Laser treatment can also improve the texture and pigmentation of burn scars. When used appropriately, &#173;these interventions can provide an alternative or adjunct to delayed reconstructive surgery.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Eyelid and Canthal Reconstruction</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid reconstruction may be needed to correct defects resulting from tumor resection as well as congenital and traumatic defects. Several techniques may be appropriate for the reconstruction of a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar eyelid defect; procedure se&#173;lection depends on multiple &#173;factors, such as the patient’s age and comorbidities, the condition of the eyelids, the size and position of the defect, and the surgeon’s personal preference. Priorities in eyelid reconstruction are</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">preserving eyelid function</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">developing a stable eyelid margin</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">ensuring adequate eyelid closure for ocular protection</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintaining adequate vertical eyelid height</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">creating a smooth, epithelialized internal surface</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">maximizing cosmesis and symmetry</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following general princi&#173;ples guide the practice of eyelid reconstruction:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-list-first">Reconstruct &#173;either the anterior or posterior eyelid lamella with a graft, but not both; 1 of the layers must provide a blood supply <span class="bullet-list_italic">(pedicle flap).</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Direct tension horizontally and minimize vertical tension.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Maintain sufficient and anatomical canthal fixation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-mid">Match tissue similar in color and thickness.</li>
					<li class="bullet-list-last">Minimize the defect area as much as pos&#173;si&#173;ble before sizing a graft.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Common sutures and &#173;needles used in eyelid reconstruction are listed in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-1">&#173;Table&#160;11-1</span>.</p>
				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Eyelid Defects Not Involving the Margin</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Defects not involving the eyelid margins can be repaired by direct closure if the repair does not distort the eyelid margin. The tension of closure should be directed horizontally &#173;because vertical tension may cause eyelid retraction or ectropion. Vertical tension may be avoided by the use of vertically oriented incisions.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If the defect is too large for direct closure, advancement or transposition of local flaps may be employed. The most commonly used flaps are advancement, rotational, and transposition flaps. Flaps usually provide the best tissue match and aesthetic result but require careful planning to minimize secondary deformities. The final texture, contour, and cosmesis are typically better with flaps than with skin grafts from sites other than eyelid skin.</p>
				<p class="body-text">If local flaps are not sufficient, eyelid defects can be repaired with full-&#173;thickness skin grafts from the upper eyelid. If this is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, grafts from the preauricular or postauricular region, supraclavicular fossa, or inner upper arm may be used (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-7">Fig&#160;11-7</span>). However, grafts of greater thickness may limit upper eyelid mobility. Grafts should be slightly oversized &#173;because contraction is likely to occur.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Split-&#173;thickness grafts should be avoided in eyelid reconstruction. They are recommended only when adequate full-&#173;thickness skin is not available.</p>
				<p class="h2">Eyelid Defects Involving the Eyelid Margin</p>
				<p class="h3-h2">Small upper eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small defects involving the upper eyelid margin can be repaired by primary closure if this technique does not place too much tension on the wound (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-8">Fig&#160;11-8</span>). Primary closure is usually employed when one-&#173;third or less of the eyelid margin is involved but may be pos&#173;si&#173;ble for larger defects in cases of floppy eyelid syndrome or extensive eyelid laxity. If a larger area is involved, the advancement of adjacent tissue or grafting of distant tissue may be required. The superior limb of the lateral canthal tendon can be released to allow 3–5&#160;mm of medial mobilization of the remaining lateral eyelid margin. Care must be taken to avoid the lacrimal ductules in the lateral upper eyelid during repair; ductule removal or destruction may lead to chronic dry eye. Postoperatively, the eyelid may initially appear tight and ptotic due to traction but typically relaxes over several weeks.</p>
				<p class="h3">Moderate upper eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Moderate upper eyelid margin defects (33%–50% margin involvement) can be repaired by advancing the lateral eyelid segment and temporal tissue. The lateral canthal tendon is released, and a semicircular skin flap is created below the lateral eyebrow, extending from the canthus to allow for further eyelid mobilization. The temporal branch of the facial nerve should be avoided when incising the flap. Tarsal-&#173;sharing procedures involving the lower eyelid may be required in younger patients with less eyelid laxity.</p>
				<p class="h3">Large upper eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upper eyelid defects involving more than half of the upper eyelid margin often require eyelid-&#173;sharing techniques or tarsoconjunctival grafts. A Cutler-&#173;Beard flap (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-9">Fig&#160;11-9</span>) begins with a horizontal full-&#173;thickness blepharotomy incision 1–2&#160;mm below the inferior border of the tarsus in the lower eyelid. The full-&#173;thickness lower eyelid flap is advanced into the defect of the upper eyelid &#173;behind the remaining lower eyelid margin. A second procedure is required to open the eyelids, and often results in a thick and relatively immobile upper eyelid. Alternatively, a tarsoconjunctival flap from the lower eyelid used in conjunction with an overlying skin graft may improve cosmesis. Eyelid-&#173;sharing procedures are less suitable for monocular patients or &#173;children in whom deprivation amblyopia may be a concern. A tarsoconjunctival graft taken from the contralateral upper eyelid and covered with a skin–&#173;muscle flap may be an option if adequate redundant upper eyelid skin is pre&#173;sent.</p>
				<p class="reference--journal--single">Jennings&#160;E, Krakauer&#160;M, Nunery&#160;WR, Aakalu&#160;VK. Advancements in the repair of large upper eyelid defects: a 10-&#173;year review. <span class="reference-single_italic">Orbit.</span> 2021;40(6):470–480.</p>
				<p class="h3">Small lower eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small defects of the lower eyelid (involving less than one-&#173;third of the margin) can be repaired by primary closure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-10">Fig&#160;11-10</span>). In addition, the inferior crus of the lateral canthal tendon can be internally or externally released to create an additional 3–5&#160;mm of medial mobilization of the remaining lateral eyelid margin.</p>
				<p class="h3">Moderate lower eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Semicircular rotational flaps, which &#173;were described &#173;earlier for upper eyelid repair, can also be used to repair moderate lower eyelid defects (involving approximately one-&#173;third to one half of the margin). Tarsoconjunctival autografts harvested from the underside of the upper eyelid may be transplanted into the lower eyelid defect to reconstruct the posterior lamella. When tarsal grafts are harvested, the marginal 4–5&#160;mm height of the upper eyelid tarsus is preserved to prevent distortion of the donor eyelid margin. Tarsoconjunctival autografts may be covered with skin flaps or skin–&#173;muscle flaps. Cheek elevation (suborbicularis oculi fat lift) may be required to avoid ectropion and vertical traction on the eyelid. Alternatively, a tarsoconjunctival flap developed from the upper eyelid and a full-&#173;thickness skin graft can be used (discussed in the next subsection) if the defect is on the larger side or if the case is not amenable to one of the other methods described.</p>
				<p class="h3">Large lower eyelid defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Defects involving more than half of the lower eyelid margin can be repaired using a tarsoconjunctival flap or graft in conjunction with an anterior lamellar flap or skin graft. A vertically based tarsoconjunctival flap (modified Hughes flap; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-11">Fig&#160;11-11</span>) from the upper eyelid can be used with an anterior lamellar flap or skin graft to reconstruct a lower eyelid full-&#173;thickness defect. Like a tarsorrhaphy, this procedure occludes the eye for several weeks. The flap is divided and inset in a second procedure several weeks &#173;later &#173;after flap revascularization has occurred. An alternative to the vertically based tarsoconjunctival flap is the laterally based tarsoconjunctival flap, a single-&#173;stage procedure best suited for lateral defects of the lower eyelid, which has the advantage of not requiring eye occlusion (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-12">Fig&#160;11-12</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">&#173;Free tarsoconjunctival grafts from the upper eyelid covered with a vascularized skin flap can also be used to repair large defects. This reconstructive approach involves a single surgical stage and prevents temporary visual axis occlusion. If a &#173;free tarsoconjunctival graft is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, hard palate grafts, nasal septal chondromucosal grafts, and ear cartilage grafts can be used to reconstruct the posterior lamella.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Large rotating cheek flaps (Mustard<span class="accent">é</span> flap; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-13">Fig&#160;11-13</span>) can work well for large anterior lamellar defect repair and are used in conjunction with a posterior lamellar reconstructive option. Both the cheek rotation flap and the semicircular rotation flap may result in a rounded lateral canthus, which can be mitigated by creating a high arching incision &#173;toward the lateral end of the eyebrow emanating from the lateral commissure.</p>

				<p class="h2">Lateral Canthal Defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lateral canthal defects may or may not involve the lateral lower eyelid and can be repaired using a semicircular rotational flap (Tenzel flap, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-14">Fig&#160;11-14</span>), O-&#173;to-&#173;Z flap (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;11-1</span>), rhomboid flap (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-15">Fig&#160;11-15</span>), or laterally based upper eyelid pedicle flap (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-16">Fig&#160;11-16</span>). If the lower eyelid tarsus is involved, a horizontal strip of periosteum and/or deep temporal fascia left attached at the lateral orbital rim can be reflected medially and attached to the tarsal remnant to reconstruct the posterior lamella (see <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-14">Fig&#160;11-14</span>). A Y-&#173;shaped periosteum pedicle flap can be used to reconstruct the entire lateral canthal posterior lamella of the upper and lower eyelids.</p>

				<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Medial Canthal Defects</p>
				<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Malignant lesions of the medial canthal region are excised with frozen sections and wide margins or Mohs micrographic surgery to minimize the risk of recurrence and invasion into the orbit and lacrimal drainage apparatus. If extensive sacrifice of both canaliculi is required when resecting a tumor, the patient may have to tolerate epiphora &#173;until tumor recurrence is deemed unlikely, &#173;after which a conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy can be considered (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;15</span>).</p>
				<p class="body-text">Medial canthal defects are typically repaired using full-&#173;thickness skin grafts, glabellar flaps, or forehead flaps or allowed to heal by second intention. When full-&#173;thickness medial eyelid defects are pre&#173;sent, medial canthal attachments should be fixed to the periosteum or bone with heavy permanent sutures (eg, Prolene, Mersilene), wire, or titanium miniplates. Defects involving the lacrimal drainage apparatus may require canalicular repair with lacrimal intubation.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Allowing medial canthal defects or other periocular defects to heal by second intention often results in acceptable functional and aesthetic outcomes. Patients must expect a longer healing time of up to 6 weeks for the defect to granulate and close. A second intention approach may be considered when surgical reconstruction is not practicable, &#173;there is insufficient donor tissue, or prior radiation has compromised the blood supply for reconstructive surgery. Hypertrophic scarring and cicatricial ectropion may occur in some cases, requiring surgical repair.</p>
				<p class="body-text">Full-&#173;thickness skin grafts are an excellent way to reconstruct medial canthal defects (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-17">Fig&#160;11-17</span>) and are thin enough to allow easy surveillance for tumor recurrence. However, full-&#173;thickness grafts are prone to postoperative contracture and may necessitate injections with wound-&#173;modulating agents. Skin grafts may not be desirable in some cases, such as when the defect involves the forehead or cheek and a skin graft would not restore adequate tissue depth. In &#173;these situations, an acellular dermal allograft or regeneration template may be considered.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The best aesthetic outcomes for medial canthal reconstruction are often achieved through careful forehead or glabellar flap transposition. However, &#173;these flaps can be thick, which may hinder the detection of recurrences. Forehead and glabellar flaps may require second-&#173;stage thinning or &#173;laser resurfacing to achieve the optimal cosmetic result.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The glabellar flap (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-18">Fig&#160;11-18</span>) is a triangular-&#173;shaped rotational flap with its base located between the brows and its apex pointing &#173;toward the forehead. Glabellar flaps are rotated approximately 120 degrees to reconstruct medial canthal defects above the level of the canthus involving the side of the nose. The donor defects created by glabellar flaps are closed by sliding both brows &#173;toward the midline, resulting in a vertical incision and reduced distance between the brows.</p>
				<p class="body-text">The paramedian forehead flap (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-19">Fig&#160;11-19</span>) is a versatile flap that can be used to reconstruct medial canthal defects below the level of the canthus, involving the nose, cheek, or lower eyelid. The paramedian flap is a long axial flap with its base centered on its blood supply, the supratrochlear artery, approximately 1.7&#160;cm from the midline. The exact course of the supratrochlear artery can be confirmed via Doppler ultrasonography. Paramedian forehead flaps are typically created contralaterally to the side of the medial canthal defect to reduce torsion at the pedicle base. The procedure requires two stages: the primary procedure and a division/inset procedure, which is performed &#173;after adequate vascularization has occurred.</p>
