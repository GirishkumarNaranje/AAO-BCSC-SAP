					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Viruses are small (10–400&#160;nm in dia&#173;meter) obligate intracellular parasites consisting of a single-&#173; or double-&#173;stranded RNA or DNA genome surrounded by a protective protein shell, or capsid, with or without an external lipid envelope (viruses are referred to as <span class="italic">enveloped</span> or <span class="italic">nonenveloped</span>). The envelope contains an outer layer of glycoproteins or spike projections (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-1">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). The host cell–&#173;derived lipid bilayer or envelope is vulnerable to damage by UV light, detergents, alcohols, and general-&#173;use antiseptics.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Characteristics of enveloped viruses (eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV], HIV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-&#173;CoV-2]) include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">They are susceptible to the external environment.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Their infectivity is short-&#173;lived outside the host.</li>

					<p class="body-text">The Baltimore classification groups viruses on the basis of how messenger RNA (mRNA) is produced during viral replication (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-2">Fig&#160;11-2</span>). Unlike DNA viruses, which direct the host cell to replicate, RNA viruses can &#173;either direct the host cell or encode RNA polymerase enzymes to replicate RNA into DNA. While antiviral vaccines work by targeting structural proteins such as the glycoproteins bound to the membrane envelope, antiviral medi&#173;cations typically target viral replication. The additional step in RNA replication commonly results in alterations in the RNA viruses, leading to increased adaptability in host cells and challenges in prevention and treatment.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Viral infections are diagnosed and treated primarily on the basis of clinical evaluation. Diagnostic testing may be necessary in aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases, in cases slow to improve, and in order to collect objective data in public health and surveillance programs. <span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-1">&#173;Table&#160;11-1</span> summarizes the benefits and limitations of vari&#173;ous diagnostic techniques.</p>

				<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The structure of all herpesviruses includes a core of linear double-&#173;stranded DNA genome, surrounded by an icosahedral protein capsid, which is contained in an envelope studded with viral glycoproteins. Of the 9 known &#173;human herpesviruses, &#173;those that affect the eye include herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-&#173;Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Kaposi sarcoma–&#173;associated herpesvirus (KSHV). All herpesviruses establish latency in their natu&#173;ral hosts, but the site of latency varies. For example, HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV establish latent infections in neurons of the sensory ganglia such as the trigeminal ganglion, while EBV and KSHV latency occurs in B lymphocytes and CMV, primarily in the lung and the salivary glands.</p>
					<p class="h2">Herpes Simplex Virus Eye Diseases</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Herpes simplex virus infections are a worldwide public health prob&#173;lem, affecting an estimated one-&#173;third of the global population. Most primary exposure to HSV occurs early in life. However, it is becoming increasingly delayed &#173;because of increased awareness about HSV infection and its symptoms; improved access to antiviral medi&#173;cations; and promotion of preventive efforts for &#173;those with genital herpes, such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and during the late stages of pregnancy.</p>
					<p class="h3">Primary ocular infection</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Primary ocular HSV infection typically manifests as a blepharoconjunctivitis. The conjunctival inflammatory response is follicular and accompanied by a palpable preauricular lymph node. Vesicles on the skin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-3">Fig&#160;11-3</span>) or eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-4">Fig&#160;11-4</span>) are impor&#173;tant for diagnosis. Epithelial keratitis can develop in patients with primary ocular HSV infection (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-5">Fig&#160;11-5</span>), but stromal keratitis and uveitis are uncommon.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Signs that can help the clinician distinguish acute primary ocular HSV infection from acute primary infection associated with adenovirus include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">vesicles on the skin or eyelid margin or ulcers on the bulbar conjunctiva (common in primary ocular HSV infection)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">dendritic epithelial keratitis (common in HSV infection)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">conjunctival membranes or pseudomembranes (typical of adenovirus infection)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Laterality is not a reliable distinguishing feature, as it is in recurrent disease. Primary HSV infections are usually unilateral but can be bilateral. In contrast, adenovirus infections are more commonly bilateral; they can be unilateral, bilateral but asymmetric, or bilateral with delayed involvement of the second eye.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> HSV-1 and HSV-2 are antigenically related. <span class="keypoint_underline">HSV-1 more commonly &#173;causes infection above the waist (orofacial and ocular infection); HSV-2, below the waist (genital infec</span><span class="keypoint_underline">tion). However, &#173;either virus can cause disease in &#173;either location.</span> Primary infection with HSV-1 frequently manifests as a nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection and is recognized as HSV less than 5% of the time. In industrialized socie&#173;ties, the age at which individuals undergo seroconversion is increasing; HSV is now more commonly acquired in adolescence than in childhood. HSV infection is spread by direct contact with infected lesions or their secretions, usually as a result of exposure to viruses shed without clinical symptoms. HSV can be transmitted to the neonate during passage through the birth canal of a &#173;mother with active genital infection. In the newborn, HSV can cause systemic infection with a high rate of mortality, including encephalitis or disease confined to the skin and mucous membranes. BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="h5-text_italic">Pediatric Ophthalmol</span><span class="h5-text_italic">ogy and Strabismus,</span> discusses congenital herpes infection in greater detail.</p>

					<p class="body-text">HSV spreads from infected skin and mucosal epithelium via sensory nerve axons to establish latent infection in associated sensory nerve ganglia, most commonly the trigeminal ganglion. Latent infection of the trigeminal ganglion may occur in the absence of recognized primary infection, and reactivation of the virus may follow in any of the 3 branches of cranial nerve V (CN V; ophthalmic nerve [V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span>], maxillary nerve [V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>], and mandibular nerve [V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">3</span>]), despite primary disease in the area of innervation of a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar branch. Approximately 0.15% of the US population has a history of external ocular HSV infection. Stromal keratitis, the most common blinding manifestation associated with HSV infection, develops in approximately one-&#173;fifth of &#173;these individuals.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Demonstration of HSV is pos&#173;si&#173;ble in active epithelial infection with viral culture or antigen or DNA detection methodologies. Results of serologic tests for neutralizing or complement-&#173;fixing immunoglobulins may show a rising antibody titer during primary infection, but &#173;these tests are of no diagnostic assistance during recurrent episodes. As most adults are latently infected with HSV, serologic testing generally is helpful only when the results are negative. Laboratory tests are indicated in complicated cases when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain and in all cases of suspected neonatal herpes infection.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Recurrent HSV infection is caused by reactivation of the virus from a latently infected sensory ganglion, transport of the virus down the nerve axon to sensory nerve endings, and subsequent infection of the ocular surface. HSV latency within the cornea as a cause of recurrent disease remains a controversial concept.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Although psychological stress, systemic infection, UV light exposure, the patient’s menstrual cycle, and contact lens wear are thought to act as triggers for the recurrence of HSV ocular disease, this hypothesis was not confirmed by the Herpetic Eye Disease Study (HEDS). However, &#173;there have been reports of UV light–&#173;induced reactivation of herpes labialis and keratitis. HSV keratitis recurs more frequently in patients with HIV infection, but the severity of the keratitis is equal to that occurring in immunocompetent persons.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Epithelial keratitis</span> One of the most common &#173;presentations of clinically recognizable recurrent ocular HSV infection is epithelial keratitis.</p>

The epithelial defect within the bed of the ulcer stains with fluorescein (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-8">Fig&#160;11-8</span>; see also Fig&#160;11-6). (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span> for a review of the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent stains.)

					<p class="body-text">Patients with HSV epithelial keratitis exhibit a ciliary flush and mild conjunctival hyperemia. Mild stromal edema and subepithelial inflammatory cell infiltration may occur beneath the epithelial keratitis. Following resolution of dendritic epithelial keratitis treated with topical antiviral agents, nonsuppurative subepithelial infiltration and scarring may be seen just posterior to the area of prior epithelial ulceration, resulting in a ghost opacity, or <span class="italic">footprint</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-10">Fig&#160;11-10</span>), which reflects the position and shape of the previous epithelial involvement. This is less likely to occur &#173;after epithelial debridement.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Focal or diffuse reduction in corneal sensation occurs during and following HSV epithelial keratitis. The distribution of corneal hypoesthesia is related to the extent, duration, severity, and number of recurrences of herpetic keratitis. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for a more detailed description of neurotrophic keratopathy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Dendriform epithelial lesions that may be confused with epithelial keratitis can develop in vari&#173;ous settings (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-3">&#173;Table&#160;11-3</span>).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> A specific clinical diagnosis of HSV infection as the cause of dendritic keratitis can usually be made on the basis of characteristic clinical features. Multinucleated &#173;giant cells (nonspecific) and intranuclear inclusions (more typical of herpesviruses) may be seen on corneal scrapings. Tissue culture, antigen detection techniques (eg, enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis in aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Most cases of HSV epithelial keratitis resolve spontaneously, and &#173;there is no evidence to suggest that topical antiviral therapy influences the subsequent development of stromal keratitis or recurrent epithelial disease. However, treatment shortens the clinical course and could conceivably reduce the magnitude of any associated herpetic neuropathy, subepithelial scarring, or the potential risk of immune-&#173;mediated diseases of the cornea. The following antiviral agents can be used alone or in combination with epithelial debridement:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">Trifluridine 1% solution 8 to 9 times daily is efficacious for both dendritic and geographic epithelial keratitis. Exacerbation of neurotrophic keratopathy and punctal stenosis may occur, especially with prolonged use.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Ganciclovir 0.15% gel &#173;every 2 hours seems to have similar efficacy and may be less toxic than trifluridine.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Acyclovir 3% ophthalmic ointment 5 times daily has been reported to be as effective as and less toxic than trifluridine, but in the United States, the topical ophthalmic form is available only through compounding pharmacies.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">Oral acyclovir 400&#160;mg 5 times daily, valacyclovir 500&#160;mg 3 times daily, or famciclovir 250&#160;mg twice daily are effective and not associated with ocular toxicity.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Antiviral treatment is generally recommended &#173;until the epithelium is healed. The frequency is then reduced for the next week and &#173;stopped rather than tapered. Treatment of the disease with topical antivirals is generally discontinued within 10 days to avoid unnecessary toxicity to the ocular surface. Gentle epithelial debridement with a dry cotton-&#173;tipped applicator or cellulose sponge speeds resolution and may be helpful as adjunctive therapy in patients with large dendrites or drug-&#173;resistant HSV keratitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Oral acyclovir is commonly used &#173;because it is as effective as topical antivirals for the treatment of epithelial keratitis and does not cause ocular toxicity. Valacyclovir, a prodrug of acyclovir, is just as effective for ocular HSV disease but can cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome in severely immunocompromised patients such as &#173;those with AIDS. Caution is warranted when using valacyclovir in patients with compromised liver or kidney function or unknown immune status. See &#173;Table&#160;11-2 for alternative systemic antiviral drugs.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Stromal keratitis</span> HSV stromal keratitis is the form of recurrent herpetic external disease that is associated with the greatest visual morbidity. Stromal involvement results from immunologic activity generated by the host against the viral antigens. Each episode of active stromal keratitis increases the risk of &#173;future episodes and reduced visual function. Live virus may also be pre&#173;sent with stromal keratitis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Herpetic stromal keratitis can be nonnecrotizing (interstitial or disciform) or necrotizing, and dif&#173;fer&#173;ent forms may pre&#173;sent si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Herpetic interstitial keratitis</span> pre&#173;sents as unifocal or multifocal interstitial haze or whitening of the stroma in the absence of epithelial ulceration (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-11">Fig&#160;11-11</span>). Mild stromal edema may accompany the haze, but epithelial edema is not typical. In the absence of significant conjunctival hyperemia or anterior chamber cells, it may be difficult to identify active disease in an area of previous scarring and thinning. Long-&#173;standing or recurrent HSV interstitial keratitis may be associated with corneal vascularization. The differential diagnosis of herpetic interstitial keratitis is presented in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-4">&#173;Table&#160;11-4</span>.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Herpetic disciform keratitis</span> is a primary endotheliitis that pre&#173;sents as a round or oval area of corneal stromal and epithelial edema with under&#173;lying keratic precipitates (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-12">Fig&#160;11-12</span>). Disciform keratitis may be confused with secondary corneal endothelial decompensation due to uveitis resulting from the presence of iridocyclitis. In disciform keratitis, however, disc-&#173;shaped stromal edema and keratic precipitates appear out of proportion to the degree of anterior chamber reaction. Disciform keratitis due to HSV and that due to VZV are clinically indistinguishable.</p>

Overlying epithelial erosion is common, but the epithelial defect may be eccentric to the infiltrate, and the edges of the epithelial ulcer do not stain with &#173;rose bengal dye.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Many past controversies regarding the optimal management of HSV stromal keratitis &#173;were resolved by the landmark HEDS (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-5">&#173;Table&#160;11-5</span>). Most importantly, HEDS findings showed that topical corticosteroids given with a prophylactic antiviral reduce per&#173;sis&#173;tence or progression of stromal inflammation and shorten the duration of HSV stromal keratitis. Long-&#173;term suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, which has proven to be relatively safe, also reduces the rate of recurrent HSV keratitis and helps preserve vision. <span class="keypoint_underline">Lifelong antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for patients with multiple recurrences of HSV stromal keratitis or sight-&#173;threatening involvement.</span> </p>

					<p class="body-text">The experimental protocol applied by HEDS investigators for patients with herpetic stromal keratitis is a useful starting point for a treatment algorithm. Initial treatment of visually significant herpetic interstitial keratitis is as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">prednisolone 1% drops &#173;every 2 hours</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">one of the following prophylactic antiviral drugs:<ul><li class="bullet-sub-list-mid _idGenParaOverride-1">topical trifluridine 4 times daily</li><li class="bullet-sub-list-mid _idGenParaOverride-1">an oral agent such as acyclovir 400&#160;mg twice daily</li><li class="bullet-sub-list-mid ParaOverride-5">valacyclovir 500&#160;mg once daily</li></ul></li>

					<p class="body-text">Subsequent treatment is as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">prednisolone drops, which are tapered &#173;every 1–2 weeks depending on degree of clinical improvement to the lowest pos&#173;si&#173;ble dosage that controls the inflammation.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">an antiviral, given to prevent severe epithelial keratitis should the patient shed HSV while using corticosteroid; continued &#173;until the patient has completely &#173;stopped the corticosteroids, or &#173;until the use is less than 1 drop of prednisolone 1% per day</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Currently available topical antiviral medi&#173;cations are not absorbed by the cornea through an intact epithelium; in contrast, orally administered acyclovir penetrates an intact cornea and anterior chamber. In this context, anecdotal evidence suggests that the patient might benefit from oral acyclovir to treat the deep corneal inflammation of disciform keratitis. The HEDS showed no additional benefit when acyclovir was added to trifluridine and prednisolone for the treatment of herpetic stromal keratitis, but disciform keratitis was not analyzed separately. Some cornea specialists routinely substitute oral acyclovir for topical trifluridine in treating disciform keratitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Necrotizing stromal keratitis</span> is prob&#173;ably the least common but most destructive form of herpetic keratitis. The diagnosis is frequently one of exclusion following negative cultures for fungal and bacterial pathogens, but it is suggested by a history of facial, conjunctival, and/or corneal HSV infection. The toxicity of topical antiviral agents may be undesirable in patients with necrotizing inflammation and can confuse the clinical picture. Therefore, an oral antiviral such as acyclovir is preferred. Fortunately, necrotizing herpetic keratitis seems to be very sensitive to topical corticosteroids, and twice-&#173;daily dosing may be sufficient to control inflammation in many patients.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Iridocyclitis</span> A history or clinical evidence of prior HSV ocular disease supports a diagnosis of HSV iridocyclitis. Granulomatous or nongranulomatous iridocyclitis may accompany necrotizing stromal keratitis or occur in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently of corneal disease. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) caused by trabeculitis, pigment dispersion, and/or patchy iris atrophy presenting as transillumination defects may occur in patients with HSV iridocyclitis. Viral antigen has been cultured from the anterior chamber of such patients and its presence positively correlated with ocular hypertension. Therefore, the diagnosis of HSV iridocyclitis is supported by the unilateral &#173;presentation associated with an elevated IOP, with or without prominent pigment dispersion and focal iris atrophy.</p>

					<p class="h3">Complications of herpetic eye disease</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of herpetic eye disease affect all layers of the cornea.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Epitheliopathy</span> When topical antiviral treatment is prolonged, epitheliopathy is common, and its severity and duration are directly related to the duration of antiviral use. Topical antiviral toxicity pre&#173;sents most commonly as diffuse punctate corneal epithelial erosions with conjunctival hyperemia. Limbal stem cell deficiency may result &#173;either from recurrent infection and inflammation or from the frequent use of topical antiviral drugs.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Neurotrophic keratopathy</span> Neurotrophic keratopathy may develop in patients secondary to previous herpetic infection. Neurotrophic keratopathy is characterized by punctate epithelial erosions, sometimes with a vortex pattern of punctate fluorescein staining; chronic epithelial regeneration lines; and frank neurotrophic ulcers. &#173;These ulcers can be distinguished from herpetic epithelial keratitis by a relative absence of &#173;rose bengal staining. Neurotrophic ulcers (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>, Fig&#160;4-5) are typically round or oval and are located in the central, inferior, or inferonasal cornea. Corneal epithelium at the edges of a neurotrophic ulcer may appear to roll &#173;under itself and typically has a gray-&#173;white, elevated appearance.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Neurotrophic keratopathy may be exacerbated by topical antiviral trifluridine treatment. For additional discussion of neurotrophic keratopathy, including management, see the section on neurotrophic keratopathy and per&#173;sis&#173;tent corneal epithelial defects in Chapter&#160;4.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Metaherpetic ulcers</span> Ulcers may also occur from neurotrophic mechanisms or a devitalized corneal stroma. Active or resolving interstitial stromal keratitis due to HSV infection is associated with a chronic epithelial defect that does not stain with &#173;rose bengal.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Per&#173;sis&#173;tent bullous keratopathy</span> Severe or long-&#173;standing disciform keratitis may result in permanent endothelial cell deficiency with per&#173;sis&#173;tent bullous keratopathy. Pain and vision loss may require &#173;either endothelial keratoplasty or full-&#173;thickness corneal transplantation.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Corneal scarring</span> Stromal inflammation in general, &#173;whether interstitial or necrotizing, commonly leads to permanent corneal scarring and irregular astigmatism. Both scarring and astigmatism may improve with time in some patients. Fitting with a gas-&#173;permeable or scleral contact lens usually improves vision beyond that achieved with spectacle refraction. In patients with deep corneal stromal vascularization due to prior necrotizing herpetic inflammation, secondary lipid keratopathy may further impair vision. Topical corticosteroids may suppress new vessel growth and halt additional lipid deposition.</p>
					<p class="h3">Surgical treatment of herpetic eye disease</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is indicated in selected patients with visually significant stromal scarring not correctable with a spectacle or contact lens. Oral antiviral therapy may improve graft survival by reducing the risk of HSV recurrence, allowing more liberal use of topical corticosteroids. DALK has the advantage of eliminating the risk of endothelial rejection. Oral antiviral agents are not toxic to the corneal epithelium and are therefore generally preferable to topical antivirals in patients &#173;after keratoplasty. Optical PK (ie, PK performed for vision rehabilitation) is successful with re&#173;spect to graft survival in nearly 80% of cases when performed in eyes without signs of active inflammation for at least 6 months before surgery. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> for additional discussion of PK and DALK.</p>
					<p class="body-text">PK is indicated in eyes with impending or frank corneal perforation due to necrotizing or neurotrophic ulcers, although stromal inflammation and ulceration may develop, and graft failure may occur. Therefore, small descemetoceles and perforations in inflamed eyes may best be treated by applying cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive and a &#173;bandage contact lens (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>, Video&#160;5-10) and delaying surgery &#173;until inflammation can be controlled. Amniotic membrane transplantation or conjunctival flaps may also be used for per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects with and without corneal thinning. &#173;After several failed keratoplasties, keratoprosthesis is an option, given the risk of subsequent graft failure due to rejection and/or recurrence in HSV corneal disease,</p>
					<p class="h2">Varicella-&#173;Zoster Virus Dermatoblepharitis, Conjunctivitis, and Keratitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with other herpesviruses, VZV &#173;causes a primary infection (varicella, or chickenpox) and establishes a subsequent latent infection, occasionally followed by recurrent disease (zoster, or shingles, discussed &#173;later in this chapter). VZV infection of childhood, now uncommon in countries with widespread VZV vaccination programs, is usually a self-&#173;limited infection rarely associated with long-&#173;term sequelae. However, infection of adults or immunosuppressed individuals can be fatal. VZV infection, &#173;whether primary or recurrent, can usually be distinguished from HSV infection through a careful history and examination. Distinguishing features of each infection are listed in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-6">&#173;Table&#160;11-6</span>.</p>
					<p class="h3">Primary infection</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In &#173;children, VZV infection manifests with fever, malaise, and a vesicular dermatitis that lasts 7–10 days. Except for eyelid vesicles and follicular conjunctivitis, ocular involvement is uncommon during primary infection.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The characteristic rash associated with chickenpox begins as macules and progresses to papules, vesicles, and then pustules that dry, crust over, and may leave individual scars. Ocular involvement may include follicular conjunctivitis, occasionally associated with a vesicular lesion on the bulbar conjunctiva or eyelid margins. Punctate or dendritic epithelial keratitis is uncommon. Although subepithelial infiltrates, microdendritic keratitis, stromal keratitis, disciform keratitis, uveitis, and elevated IOP are rare, varicella keratouveitis may be recurrent and cause significant morbidity in some patients.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Primary VZV infection occurs upon direct contact with VZV skin lesions or respiratory secretions via airborne droplets and is highly contagious for previously uninfected individuals. As with HSV, the site of VZV latency is the sensory ganglia and, in approximately 20% of infected individuals, the virus reactivates &#173;later. Of all cases of VZV infection, 15% involve CN V, the trigeminal nerve.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Acute or recurrent VZV infection can be confirmed in the laboratory by immunodiagnostic methods, viral culture, and PCR. Serologic testing is used primarily to identify adults who have not previously been infected and might benefit from prophylactic vaccination. As with HSV, scrapings from the base of a vesicle can be tested by cytology, PCR, or culture, or for the presence of VZV antigen. Conjunctival scrapings or corneal impression cytology specimens can be similarly analyzed by culture, antigen detection, or PCR.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> &#173;Because infected individuals shed the virus in respiratory secretions before the onset of the characteristic rash, avoiding infected persons is not always pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Vaccination against varicella is recommended for anyone older than 1 year without a history of chickenpox or with a negative serologic test result. The severity of signs and symptoms may be reduced in clinically ill patients by the administration of oral acyclovir. <span class="keypoint_underline">In contrast with HSV epithelial keratitis, significant VZV keratitis can be treated with topical corticosteroids.</span> </p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Zoster manifests as a painful vesicular dermatitis typically localized to a single dermatome on the thorax or face. Initially, affected patients may report fever and malaise and experience warmth, redness, and increased sensation in the affected dermatome. The most commonly affected dermatomes are on the thorax (vertebrae T3 through L3) and &#173;those supplied by CN V.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO)</span> refers to involvement of the ophthalmic division (V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>) of CN V (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-14">Fig&#160;11-14</span>), which is affected more often than the maxillary and mandibular branches. A maculopapular rash, followed by vesicles and then pustules, is characteristic. Zoster dermatitis may result in large scabs that resolve slowly and leave significant scarring. Neurotrophic keratopathy and sectoral iris atrophy are characteristic. Inflammation of almost any ocular tissue can occur and recur in HZO.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Zoster dermatitis</span> is accompanied by pain and dysesthesia. The pain usually decreases as lesions resolve; however, neuralgia in the affected dermatome can continue for months to years. The severity of pain ranges from mild to incapacitating. Ocular involvement occurs in more than 70% of patients with zoster of CN V<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span> and may appear in association with the nasociliary, frontal, or lacrimal branch. Ophthalmic complications may also occur with zoster of the second (maxillary) division of CN V. In immunosuppressed patients, zoster may involve more than 1 division of the trigeminal nerve at the same time; &#173;after reactivation, disease may be chronic, and &#173;there may be multiple recurrences. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> for discussion of the innervation of the eye and face.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Eyelid vesicular eruption can lead to secondary bacterial infection, eyelid scarring, marginal notching, loss of cilia, trichiasis, and cicatricial entropion or ectropion. Scarring and occlusion of the lacrimal puncta or canaliculi may occur, resulting in dry eye or excessive tearing.

In patients with AIDS, &#173;these may be chronically culture-&#173;positive for VZV. Diminished corneal sensation occurs in up to 50% of patients. Nummular corneal infiltrates are said to be characteristic of zoster stromal keratitis, but the interstitial keratitis, disciform keratitis, and anterior uveitis with increased IOP in HZO are clinically indistinguishable from &#173;those caused by HSV infection. Chronic corneal stromal inflammation can lead to corneal vascularization, lipid keratopathy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-16">Fig&#160;11-16</span>), and corneal opacity.

					<p class="body-text">Studies indicate that the incidence of herpes zoster rises with increasing age, starting from age 50&#160;years.

For patients at risk of disseminated zoster due to immunosuppression, intravenous acyclovir therapy (10&#160;mg/kg &#173;every 8 hours) is indicated. Cutaneous lesions may be treated with warm, moist compresses and topical antibiotic ointment. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics are indicated for keratouveitis. IOP can rise as a result of herpetic uveitis and should be closely monitored. The use of oral corticosteroids is controversial, as no clear impact has been shown on the incidence or duration of PHN.&#160;However, some clinicians use a tapering dosage for patients older than 60&#160;years with HZO to reduce the severity and duration of subsequent PHN. The Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) is currently evaluating &#173;whether prophylaxis with oral antivirals may be indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent ocular complications, including epithelial and stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis, following HZO.</p>
					<p class="body-text">PHN may respond to capsaicin cream applied to the involved skin, but low doses of amitriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine, or carbamazepine may be necessary to control severe symptoms.

					<p class="h2">Epstein-&#173;Barr Virus Dacryoadenitis, Conjunctivitis, and Keratitis</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Patients with EBV-&#173;associated dacryoadenitis, conjunctivitis, or keratitis have a history of recent infectious mononucleosis and/or per&#173;sis&#173;tently high EBV serologic titers. The diagnosis is made on the basis of &#173;either or both of &#173;these &#173;factors. EBV is the most common cause of acute dacryoadenitis, which is characterized by inflammatory enlargement of 1 or both lacrimal glands. Acute follicular conjunctivitis, Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome, and bulbar conjunctival nodules have been reported in patients with acute infectious mononucleosis and may be the result of EBV infection.</p>
					<p class="body-text">EBV-&#173;associated keratitis may be unilateral or bilateral and may, in some cases, appear similar to the interstitial keratitis induced by HSV, VZV, adenovirus, Lyme disease, or syphilis. &#173;There are 3 principal forms of EBV stromal keratitis:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">type 1: multifocal subepithelial infiltrates that resemble &#173;those of adenoviral keratitis</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">type 2: multifocal, blotchy, pleomorphic infiltrates with active inflammation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-17">Fig&#160;11-17</span>) or granular ring-&#173;shaped opacities (inactive form) in the anterior to midstroma</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">type 3: multifocal deep or full-&#173;thickness peripheral infiltrates, with or without vascularization, that resemble &#173;those of interstitial keratitis due to syphilis</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because ocular disease resulting from EBV infection is rare, clinical suspicion for it is usually low; EBV should be considered in patients with disease refractory to conventional antiviral treatment.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> EBV is a common herpesvirus that infects most &#173;humans by early adulthood. Spread of EBV occurs through the sharing of saliva, and the virus results in subclinical infection in the first &#173;decade of life. If acquired &#173;later in life, it can cause infectious mononucleosis. The virus remains latent in B lymphocytes and pharyngeal mucosal epithelial cells throughout life.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> &#173;Because it is difficult to isolate the virus, the diagnosis of EBV infection depends on the detection of antibodies to vari&#173;ous viral components. During acute infection, first immunoglobulin (Ig) M and then IgG antibodies to viral capsid antigens (VCAs) appear. Anti-&#173;VCA IgG may persist throughout the patient’s life. &#173;There is an increase in the level of antibodies to early antigens during the acute phases of the disease and a subsequent decrease to low or undetectable levels in most individuals. Antibodies to EBV nuclear antigens appear weeks to months &#173;later, providing serologic evidence of past infection. Study results suggest that the use of EBV PCR could increase the number of positive diagnoses by more than 16% by confirming a positive IgM VCA in the absence of heterophilic antibodies.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Acyclovir is not an effective treatment for the clinical signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, but the impact of antiviral therapy on the corneal manifestations of EBV infection remains unknown. Corticosteroids may be effective in patients with reduced vision due to apparent EBV stromal keratitis, but they should not be administered without a prophylactic antiviral if HSV infection is a possibility.</p>
					<p class="h2">Cytomegalovirus Keratitis and Anterior Uveitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytomegalovirus is a widespread herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of &#173;humans by 80&#160;years of age.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> CMV infection has been most commonly associated with a sectoral, necrotizing retinitis found almost exclusively in patients with AIDS or other immunocompromised states. Few anterior segment complications have been associated with CMV retinitis, with the exception of thin stellate keratic precipitates. In rare cases, epithelial and stromal CMV keratitis have been described, usually when CMV infection was undiagnosed prior to keratoplasty. <span class="keypoint_underline">However, CMV has increasingly been identified as a significant cause of anterior uveitis and corneal endotheliitis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-18">Fig&#160;11-18</span>). It should be suspected in patients presenting with graft rejection that does not respond well to corticosteroids.</span> The presence of keratic precipitates, endothelial cell loss, and diffuse or local corneal edema suggests CMV endotheliitis. The anterior uveitis is characterized by acute or chronic anterior chamber inflammation, with moderate to severe increases in IOP that are variably responsive to topical corticosteroids. &#173;These &#173;presentations are often misdiagnosed as HSV-&#173;related endotheliitis, trabeculitis, Posner-&#173;Schlossman syndrome (glaucomatocyclitic crisis), or endothelial graft rejection and can be distinguished only by their response to therapy and by results of laboratory investigation.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Spread of CMV occurs through contact with infectious body fluids such as saliva and breast milk, as well as through sexual contact. CMV &#173;causes subclinical infection in &#173;children and a nonspecific febrile illness lasting 1–3 weeks in adults. CMV viremia transmits virus to the bone marrow, where it becomes latent &#173;until activated, which enables expression and shedding of the virus.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Laboratory confirmation of CMV-&#173;associated anterior segment disease is usually accomplished through PCR testing for CMV in the aqueous humor. Aqueous humor is obtained by an anterior chamber tap, which must be performed during an episode of active disease for greatest yield. Concurrent serum testing should also be performed to rule out a systemic viremia as a cause of intraocular infection. In addition, concomitant testing for other herpesviruses can be performed. CMV-&#173;associated anterior segment disease may also be diagnosed through histologic examination of corneal biopsy or surgical specimens.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The optimal treatment of CMV-&#173;associated anterior segment disease is unknown, but treatment with oral valganciclovir 900&#160;mg twice daily, with the possibility of lower maintenance dosing, is effective. Valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, may be poorly tolerated, and recurrence of disease with withdrawal of the medi&#173;cation is common. Alternatives include ganciclovir implants and topical ganciclovir, which has demonstrated therapeutic effects when used as an adjunct to systemic therapy and when used in a maintenance role. Recurrence is pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;after keratoplasty. The role of corticosteroids is unclear, as corticosteroid use may prolong or worsen CMV-&#173;associated anterior segment disease. <span class="keypoint_underline">Caution is warranted when using corticosteroids in &#173;these patients.</span> </p>

Each subgroup (A–&#173;F) of adenoviruses and, to a lesser degree, each serotype has unique tissue affinity that results in the association of specific adenoviruses with distinct clinical syndromes.</p>

					</ul>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The dif&#173;fer&#173;ent adenoviral syndromes are indistinguishable early in infection and may be unilateral or bilateral.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Adenoviral follicular conjunctivitis</span> is self-&#173;limited, not associated with systemic disease, and often so transient that patients do not seek care. Epithelial keratitis, if pre&#173;sent, is mild and fleeting.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pharyngoconjunctival fever</span> is characterized by fever, headache, pharyngitis, follicular conjunctivitis, and preauricular adenopathy. The systemic signs and symptoms may mimic &#173;those of influenza. Any associated epithelial keratitis is mild.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)</span> is the only adenoviral syndrome with significant corneal involvement and may be preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. EKC is bilateral in most patients. One week to 10 days &#173;after inoculation, edema of the conjunctiva, plica semilunaris, and caruncle occurs; and severe follicular conjunctivitis develops, associated with a punctate epithelial keratitis. The conjunctival morphology is follicular but may be obscured by chemosis. Petechial conjunctival hemorrhages and, occasionally, larger subconjunctival hemorrhages can occur. Preauricular adenopathy is prominent. Pseudomembranes or true membranes, which bleed upon removal (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-19">Fig&#160;11-19</span>) and consist of mucus, fibrin, and inflammatory cells, occur predominantly on the palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva. It can therefore be helpful to evert the upper eyelid for evaluation if the diagnosis is not other&#173;wise obvious. Patients report tearing, light sensitivity, and foreign-&#173;body sensation. Although both eyes are often involved, signs and symptoms are typically less pronounced in the second eye. Large central geographic corneal erosions can develop and may persist for several days despite taping the eyelid closed (patching) and lubrication. Within 7–14 days &#173;after onset of ocular symptoms, multifocal, moderate-&#173;sized subepithelial and anterior stromal corneal infiltrates become apparent on slit-&#173;lamp examination (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-20">Fig&#160;11-20</span>). Photophobia and reduced vision from adenoviral subepithelial infiltrates may persist for months to years. Long-&#173;term complications of conjunctival membranes include subepithelial conjunctival scarring, symblepharon formation, and dry eye due to alterations within the lacrimal glands or lacrimal ducts.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Adenoviruses are transmitted by close contact with ocular or respiratory secretions, contaminated fomites, or contaminated swimming pools. Transmission occurs more readily in populations living in close quarters, such as schools, nursing homes, military housing, and summer camps.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Transmission of adenoviruses by contaminated instruments or eyedrops in physicians’ offices may also occur. For this reason, IOP &#173;measurements should preferably be taken with an instrument that has a disposable cover.</p>

					<p class="body-text ParaOverride-8">In&#160;EKC, epithelial keratitis occurs &#173;because of adenovirus replication within the corneal epithelium. Subepithelial infiltrates are likely caused by an immunopathologic response to viral infection of keratocytes in the superficial corneal stroma.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span><span class="CharOverride-2"> </span>The diagnosis of EKC is suspected in patients with bilateral follicular conjunctivitis associated with petechial conjunctival hemorrhages, conjunctival membrane formation, or the subsequent presence of bilateral subepithelial infiltrates.

A rapid immunodetection assay to detect adenovirus antigens in the conjunctiva is commercially available.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Therapy for adenoviral ocular infection is primarily supportive. Cool compresses and artificial tears may provide symptomatic relief.

					<p class="body-text">Actively infected persons readily transmit adenoviruses. Viral shedding may persist for 10–14 days &#173;after the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Transmission can be prevented by personal hygiene &#173;measures, including frequent handwashing; avoiding the sharing of towels, pillowcases, and handkerchiefs; and disposal of contaminated facial tissues. An infected individual who works with the public, in a school, or in a health care fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar should consider a temporary leave of absence from work to prevent infecting &#173;others. Patients with continued chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and tearing are still considered to be infectious. It is more difficult to assess transmissibility in patients treated with topical corticosteroids, who may still shed the virus even though the disease appears to be well controlled.</p>
					<p class="h2">Poxviruses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The poxviruses are a large &#173;family (Poxviridae) of enveloped, double-&#173;stranded DNA viruses with a distinctive brick or ovoid shape and a complex capsid structure. The best-&#173;known poxviruses are molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia (cowpox), variola (smallpox), and mpox (monkeypox).</p>
					<p class="h3">Molluscum contagiosum</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Molluscum contagiosum occurs most commonly in &#173;children and is characterized by the presence of small, waxy, dome-&#173;shaped epidermal nodules with central umbilication. A molluscum nodule is smaller and associated with less inflammation in comparison to a keratoacanthoma (see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="h5-text_italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>). The diagnosis is based on detection of the characteristic eyelid lesions in the presence of a follicular conjunctivitis. Punctate epithelial erosions and, in rare cases, a corneal pannus may occur. A careful search for eyelid margin molluscum lesions should be initiated in the presence of chronic follicular conjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-21">Fig&#160;11-21</span>). Extensive facial and eyelid lesions can be seen in cases of poorly controlled AIDS (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-22">Fig&#160;11-22</span>). The lesions can also pre&#173;sent in young girls as a result of sharing makeup.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Molluscum contagiosum virus is spread by direct contact with infected individuals. Infection produces 1 or more nodules on the skin and eyelid margin and, less commonly, on the conjunctiva. Eyelid nodules release viral particles into the tear film, which leads to follicular conjunctivitis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The molluscum contagiosum virus cannot be cultured using standard techniques. Histologic examination of an expressed or excised nodule shows eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions within epidermal cells (see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="h5-text_italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Spontaneous resolution occurs but can take months to years. Treatment options include complete excision, cryotherapy, or incision and curettage of the central portion of the lesion.</p>
					<p class="h3">Vaccinia</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Concern that the variola virus, the etiologic agent of smallpox, might be used as a biological weapon has prompted the reinstitution of a smallpox vaccination program, especially for military personnel, using live vaccinia virus. Ocular complications from self-&#173;inoculation have been reported, including potentially severe periorbital pustules, conjunctivitis, and keratitis. Treatment includes topical trifluridine. Use of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) is controversial but is indicated for severe ocular disease. Concern about the use of VIG stems from &#173;limited rabbit studies that have demonstrated a pos&#173;si&#173;ble increase in corneal scarring. Individuals who are immunosuppressed, atopic, pregnant, breastfeeding, allergic to the vaccine, or living with a high-&#173;risk &#173;house&#173;hold contact should not receive the vaccine &#173;because of the risk of possibly fatal, progressive vaccinia.</p>

					<p class="h3">Mpox</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Initially described in 1958, mpox (formerly monkeypox) garnered attention &#173;after an outbreak in 2022. It is a zoonotic viral disease (a disease of nonhuman animals that can be transmitted to &#173;humans) found primarily in Central and West Africa. Rarely fatal, mpox is usually a mild and self-&#173;limited disease. Affected patients typically have flulike symptoms. The most commonly affected ocular site is the conjunctiva. Ocular symptoms may include conjunctival hyperemia and/or discharge, while signs may include conjunctival ulcers, disseminated blistering or papular conjunctival lesions, follicular reaction, and pseudomembranous or subconjunctival nodules. Infected individuals may have a vesicular rash in the periorbital/orbital area and eyelid involvement. &#173;People who are immunocompromised and persons unvaccinated against smallpox are more susceptible to the conjunctivitis, as are &#173;children and bedridden patients. Corneal pitting, ulceration/keratitis, and scarring may cause permanent visual morbidity, and mpox can cause vision loss.</p>

Early viral gene products stimulate cell growth and lead to a skin wart or a conjunctival papilloma. As HPV-&#173;containing basal epithelial cells mature and differentiate into superficial epithelial cells, they allow for complete viral gene expression and produce infectious virus. HPV-16 and HPV-18 ste&#173;reo&#173;typically integrate their viral genome into host chromosomal DNA, which is associated with malignant transformation and squamous cell carcinoma. Immunization strategies designed to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer are specifically targeted against HPV oncogenes, which may result in a decreased incidence of &#173;these tumors in the &#173;future.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eye infections due to RNA viruses are less common than &#173;those due to DNA viruses, and &#173;these infections usually manifest as follicular conjunctivitis associated with an upper res&#173;piratory tract infection (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 11-8">&#173;Table&#160;11-8</span>). Certain RNA virus infections may cause pathologic changes in virtually any ocular tissue; for example, influenza virus can affect the lacrimal gland, cornea, iris, &#173;retina, optic nerve, and other cranial nerves.</p>
					<p class="h2">Orthomyxoviruses</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Influenza</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The H7 subtype of influenza A viruses has historically demonstrated a unique propensity for infecting the eye. This contrasts with other subtypes, which rarely infect the eye. H7 viruses have been associated with ocular complications such as conjunctivitis, often with concurrent mild respiratory illness. Ocular swabs of conjunctivitis cases have been positive for H7 viruses. In addition to conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, uveitis, retinopathy, and optic neuritis have occurred in individuals with confirmed influenza.</p>

					<p class="h2">Coronaviruses</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">COVID-19</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multiorgan disease caused by severe acute res&#173;piratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-&#173;CoV-2), a single-&#173;stranded, enveloped RNA virus. In 2020, the disease rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in a pandemic. Individuals with COVID-19 can also have ocular involvement, most commonly conjunctivitis. The incidence of conjunctivitis ranges from 0.8% to 31.6%.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A rare COVID-19–&#173;related inflammatory disease has been reported to develop in &#173;children; this condition has been named <span class="italic">multisystem inflammatory syndrome in &#173;children (MIS-&#173;C).</span> &#173;Children with this syndrome exhibit symptoms similar to &#173;those observed in Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome, including fever, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, and rash. &#173;Children diagnosed with MIS-&#173;C are hospitalized; intravenous remdesivir has been shown to shorten hospitalization time. The use of dexamethasone has shown efficacy in patients with severe respiratory disease. Several vaccines have shown a high degree of efficacy in large clinical &#173;trials.</p>
					<p class="h2">Paramyxoviruses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Paramyxoviruses are single-&#173;stranded, enveloped RNA viruses that cause numerous &#173;human diseases, the most-&#173;recognized of which are measles and mumps.</p>
					<p class="h3">Measles</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The classic triad of postnatally acquired measles (rubeola) consists of cough, coryza, and follicular conjunctivitis. Mild epithelial keratitis may be pre&#173;sent. Optic neuritis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusion, and pigmentary retinopathy occur less commonly. Measles keratopathy, a major source of blindness in resource-&#173;limited regions globally, typically pre&#173;sents as corneal ulceration in malnourished, vitamin A–&#173;deficient &#173;children (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>). A rare and fatal complication of infection with the measles virus, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 cases, often years &#173;after clinically apparent measles.</p>
					<p class="h3">Mumps</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infection with the mumps virus may result in dacryoadenitis, sometimes concurrent with parotid gland involvement. Follicular conjunctivitis, epithelial and stromal keratitis, anterior uveitis, trabeculitis, and scleritis have all been reported within the first 2 weeks &#173;after onset of parotitis.</p>
					<p class="h2">Matonaviruses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Matonaviridae is a &#173;family of small, enveloped viruses with single-&#173;stranded positive-&#173;sense RNA genomes. The single genus, <span class="italic">Rubivirus,</span> includes rubella virus.</p>
					<p class="h3">Rubella</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rubella virus, when acquired in utero, may cause microphthalmos, corneal haze, cataracts, iris hypoplasia, iridocyclitis, glaucoma, and salt-&#173;and-&#173;pepper pigmentary retinopathy. Congenital ocular abnormalities due to rubella are much worse when maternal infection occurs early in pregnancy. Measles, mumps, and rubella are uncommon in places where childhood vaccination is regularly performed.</p>
					<p class="h2">Picornaviruses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The picornaviruses are a &#173;family of single-&#173;stranded, nonenveloped viruses that can cause a wide range of disease, including the common cold, polio, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.</p>
					<p class="h3">Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) can be caused by infection with enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24 variant, and (less commonly) adenovirus 11. One of the most dramatic ocular viral syndromes, AHC is characterized by sudden onset of follicular conjunctivitis in association with multiple petechial hemorrhages of bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva. The hemorrhages may become confluent and resemble &#173;those associated with trauma (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 11-24">Fig&#160;11-24</span>). Eyelid edema, preauricular adenopathy, chemosis, and punctate epithelial keratitis may be associated with infection. AHC is highly contagious and occurs in large and rapidly spreading epidemics. In approximately 1 out of 10,000 cases due to enterovirus 70, a polio-&#173;like paralysis follows; neurologic deficits are permanent in up to one-&#173;third of affected individuals.</p>
					<p class="h2">Retroviruses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retroviruses are single-&#173;stranded, enveloped RNA viruses that encode a viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, which assists in conversion of the single-&#173;stranded RNA genome into a circular double-&#173;stranded DNA molecule.</p>
					<p class="h3">&#173;Human immunodeficiency virus</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The retrovirus of greatest medical importance is HIV, the etiologic agent of AIDS. HIV is transmitted via sexual contact at mucosal surfaces; from &#173;mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding; through blood transfusion; or via blood-&#173;contaminated &#173;needles and syringes. Sexually transmitted infection is facilitated by uptake of HIV by dendritic cells at mucosal surfaces. CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes are a primary target of the virus, as are dendritic cells and monocyte-&#173;macrophages. Infection of &#173;these cell types induces predictable defects of innate and acquired (both humoral and cellular) immunity. Primary viremia results in an infectious mononucleosis–&#173;like HIV prodrome, followed by seeding of the peripheral lymphoid organs and development of a &#173;measurable immune response. During this seroconversion prodrome, conjunctivitis occurs in a small number of patients and is self-&#173;limited. Infected patients may remain other&#173;wise asymptomatic for several years, but CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes are progressively depleted. Clinical immunodeficiency eventually develops.</p>
