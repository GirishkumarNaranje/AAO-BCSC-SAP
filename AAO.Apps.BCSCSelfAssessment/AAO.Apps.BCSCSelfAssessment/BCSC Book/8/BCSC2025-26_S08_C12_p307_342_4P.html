					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial colonization of the eyelid margin and conjunctiva is normal and can be beneficial as long as normal flora competitively inhibit pathogenic strains. The spectrum of normal ocular flora varies with the age and geographic locale of the host. In the eye of an infant delivered vaginally, multiple bacterial species predominate, including <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,</span> streptococci, and <span class="italic">Escherichia coli.</span> Streptococci and pneumococci predominate during the first 2 &#173;decades of life. Although gram-&#173;negative bacteria occur more frequently in the external eye as an individual ages, <span class="italic">S epidermidis,</span> other coagulase-&#173;negative staphylococci, <span class="italic">S aureus,</span> and diphtheroids are common throughout life (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-1">&#173;Table&#160;12-1</span>). Nonpathogenic colonization of the eyelid margin with <span class="italic">Demodex folliculorum</span> and <span class="italic">Demodex brevis</span> increases with age. <span class="keypoint_underline">Any disturbance in the ocular surface (eg, contact lens wear, tear deficiency, or application of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids) can alter the flora of the eyelid and conjunctiva.</span> </p>

			<p class="h1">Pathogenesis of Ocular Infections</p>
				<div  id="Chapt12_Top2">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many microorganisms are capable of causing infectious diseases of the cornea and external eye; the most common of &#173;these pathogens are listed in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-2">&#173;Table&#160;12-2</span>. Ocular infection can occur via exogenous inoculation or, in rare cases, by hematogenous seeding. Characteristics of an infection—&#173;including its onset and severity—&#173;are a function of multiple &#173;factors: the virulence of the pathogen, the inoculum size, and the competence and nature of host defense mechanisms. Virulence &#173;factors represent evolutionary adaptations in microorganisms that confer increased odds of infection and survival. Correspondingly, more virulent pathogens are more likely to cause infection than an equal number of less virulent pathogens. The status of host defense mechanisms also determines the inoculum amount at which infection is likely to occur.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In many species of microorganisms, ocular infection is established by characteristic pathogenic mechanisms. Following exogenous inoculation, adherence to the ocular surface is the first step. To facilitate this &#173;process, some microorganisms (eg, <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> and <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> trophozoites) express adhesins, proteins that bind with high affinity to molecules on the host cell surface. A few organisms can invade an intact epithelium (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-3">&#173;Table&#160;12-3</span>), but most must rely on a disrupted epithelial barrier. Microbial proteases facilitate host invasion by inducing cell lysis, degrading the extracellular matrix, and activating corneal matrix–&#173;derived metalloproteinases in the host cell to trigger autodigestion. Bacterial exotoxins, such as &#173;those produced by streptococci, staphylococci, and <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</span> can induce corneal cell necrosis. <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> species and certain fungi secrete collagenases. <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> secretes enzymes that destroy collagen and proteoglycan components of the cornea. &#173;These enzymes also degrade immunoglobulins, complement proteins, interleukins, and other inflammatory cytokines.</p>
					<p class="body-text">&#173;After adhering, certain bacterial species avoid host-&#173;cell phagocytosis by &#173;organizing into a biofilm. In most acute infections, pathogenic microorganisms are eventually cleared, but in some cases, the pathogen persists in the host in&#173;def&#173;initely. For example, chlamydial organisms persist within intracellular phagosomes, yielding chronic localized disease. Further discussion of bacteriology, mycology, and parasitology pertinent to ocular infection is included in the online Appendix, available at <a target="_blank" href="http://aao.org/bcscsupplement_section08">aao.&#173;org/&#173;bcscsupplement_&#173;section08</a>.</p>

					<p class="h2-h1">Diagnostic Laboratory Techniques</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The recent increase in aty&#173;pi&#173;cal ocular infections and the emergence of antibiotic-&#173;resistant strains have underscored the importance of procedures for specific microbiologic diagnosis. However, an understanding of the normal flora and cytology of the ocular surface is needed in order to interpret findings in infectious diseases. Materials for specimen collection and evaluation are summarized in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-4">&#173;Tables&#160;12-4</span> and <span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-5">12-5</span>.</p>

					<p class="h2">Specimen Collection</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Recovery of organisms for bacterial culture can be maximized and the culture positivity rate improved by allowing the plates and thioglycolate broth to warm to room temperature. The broth can be warmed by holding the tube containing it. Dipping the sterile swab in the broth before harvesting the organisms from the cornea &#173;will also improve culture results. Microscope slides may then be prepared for Gram, Giemsa, or other special stains. To avoid contamination and false-&#173;positive results, the specimen-&#173;collection tool should not be touched to any nonsterile surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">While &#173;there is no universally preferred method of plate inoculation, the C-&#173;shaped streak method (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-1">Fig&#160;12-1</span>) is used in many microbiology laboratories. A separate sterile instrument or swab is required for each row of C-&#173;shaped streaks on the agar plate and for each type of culture broth. Superficial streaks are used to avoid breaking the gel surface while inoculating the cultures on the plate. If agar plates and broth are unavailable, culture transport tubes may be used. Consultation and collaboration with the microbiology laboratory is key to avoiding errors in specimen preparation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When culture results are negative, a second culture in alternative media may be considered, especially in a case of a corneal ulcer that is nonresponsive to treatment. A medi&#173;cation washout period may be advisable to improve the likelihood of recovering a detectable amount of the disease agent.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When the results of repeated cultures of corneal scrapings are negative in cases of apparent microbial infection, <span class="italic">corneal biopsy</span> may be performed (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>). The tests and techniques collectively known as <span class="italic">molecular diagnostics,</span> of which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one example, can add diagnostic value for assessment of pathogens that are difficult to culture in vitro or that require a long cultivation period, such as <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span>.

					<p class="h2-h1">Staphylococcal Blepharitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Staphylococcal bacteria on the anterior eyelid margin can cause blepharitis. Although this condition has an infectious etiology, inflammation plays a significant role and can result in bacterial overgrowth and a prolonged local immune response, despite antimicrobial therapy. Tears contain inhibitors of bacterial growth, and cases of tear deficiency often are accompanied by staphylococcal blepharitis. The inflammation associated with blepharitis can also lead to dry eye symptoms. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3 for additional discussion.</span></p>

The infestation may be mitigated by applying diluted tea tree oil to the base of the eyelashes. Weekly use of ivermectin 1% cream (currently not available in the United States for ophthalmic use) has been shown to improve symptoms when compared with eyelid hygiene alone. Lotilaner ophthalmic solution 0.25%, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of <span class="italic">Demodex</span> blepharitis, was shown to significantly reduce cylindrical eyelash sleeves, decrease or eradicate mites, and reduce eyelid erythema &#173;after 6 weeks of twice-&#173;daily use.

					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Bacterial Conjunctivitis in &#173;Children and Adults</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Bacterial conjunctivitis is the likely diagnosis in patients who pre&#173;sent with conjunctival inflammation and purulent discharge. The rapidity of onset, severity of conjunctival inflammation, and presence of discharge can be helpful in determining the pos&#173;si&#173;ble causative organism (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-6">&#173;Table&#160;12-6</span>). In &#173;children, conjunctivitis of bacterial and viral etiologies occurs at similar rates, whereas 80% of cases of infectious conjunctivitis in adults is viral in origin. Although usually self-&#173;limited, bacterial conjunctivitis is occasionally severe and sight-&#173;threatening, particularly when caused by virulent species, such as <span class="h5-text_italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> or <span class="h5-text_italic">Streptococcus pyogenes.</span> In rare cases, bacterial conjunctivitis precedes life-&#173;threatening systemic disease, such as in cases of <span class="h5-text_italic">Neisseria meningitidis</span> infection<span class="h5-text_italic">.</span></p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by bacterial overgrowth, infiltration of the conjunctival epithelial layer, and sometimes extension into the substantia propria. The infection is transmitted &#173;either by direct contact with an infected individual’s secretions (usually, eye–&#173;hand contact) or from the patient’s own nasal and sinus mucosa to the eye. In an adult with unilateral bacterial conjunctivitis, the nasolacrimal system should be examined; nasolacrimal duct obstruction, dacryocystitis, or canaliculitis may be the under&#173;lying cause.</p>
					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Acute purulent conjunctivitis</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Acute purulent conjunctivitis is a self-&#173;limited infection of the conjunctiva characterized by an acute inflammatory response with purulent discharge of less than 3 weeks’ duration (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-3">Fig&#160;12-3</span>). Conjunctivitis caused by <span class="h5-text_italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> involves moderate purulent discharge, eyelid edema, chemosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, inflammatory membranes on the palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva (occasionally), and corneal ulceration (rare). In young &#173;children, conjunctivitis due to <span class="h5-text_italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span> infection may occur alongside otitis media; in adults, conjunctivitis associated with chronic <span class="h5-text_italic">H in</span><span class="h5-text_italic">fluenzae</span> infection is pos&#173;si&#173;ble (eg, in smokers or patients with chronic bronchopulmonary disease). Of note, the incidence of <span class="h5-text_italic">H influenzae</span> infection has been reduced by vaccination against <span class="h5-text_italic">H influenzae</span> type b. Infection with <span class="h5-text_italic">S aureus</span> may lead to acute blepharoconjunctivitis associated with discharge that, when compared with pneumococcal conjunctivitis, involves less purulent discharge and generally less severe signs of infection.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Cases may occur spontaneously, with an associated infectious &#173;process elsewhere in the body, or may be due to contagious spread. The most common pathogens in acute purulent conjunctivitis—&#173;<span class="h5-text_italic">S pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, H influenzae,</span> and <span class="h5-text_italic">S&#160;aureus—&#173;</span>occur at frequencies dependent on patient age and geographic location.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Gram-&#173;stain smears and culture of the conjunctiva are usually not necessary in uncomplicated, predominantly self-&#173;limited cases of suspected bacterial conjunctivitis but are recommended for the following groups:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">patients who are immunocompromised—&#173;including neonates and debilitated individuals—to assess the risk of local and systemic complications</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">patients with severe purulent conjunctivitis, to differentiate it from hyperpurulent conjunctivitis, which generally requires systemic therapy</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">patients in whom the initial therapy failed</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis resolve in 2 to 7 days without treatment. Results of multiple prospective studies have suggested that delaying treatment &#173;until day 3 or 4 can significantly decrease the unnecessary use of antibiotics, without affecting outcomes. &#173;After this delay, initiating treatment only in patients with per&#173;sis&#173;tent or worsening signs would still be expected to shorten the disease course and improve symptoms. If the conjunctivitis is improving on day 4, antibiotics may not be necessary. Cases likely due to viral infection should <span class="h5-text_italic">not</span> be treated routinely with antibiotics.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If further intervention is indicated, it can be directed by the results of the Gram stain of the conjunctival smear. However, it is preferable to base treatment on the findings of bacterial culture, as smear results may be inconclusive. If an associated sinusitis or pharyngitis is pre&#173;sent, cultures of the nose or throat may be obtained. In cases of relapsing conjunctivitis, even if no overt sinusitis, rhinitis, or pharyngitis is pre&#173;sent, it is recommended that nasal or throat swabs be obtained &#173;because organisms in the respiratory tract mucosa may be the source of infection.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Empiric therapy</span> with a topical broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic may be initiated before results of the Gram stain or culture have been received. The dosing schedule is 4 to 6 times daily for approximately 5 to 7 days &#173;unless other&#173;wise indicated. Supplemental oral antibiotics may be given to patients in the following groups:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">patients with acute purulent conjunctivitis associated with pharyngitis</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">cases of conjunctivitis-&#173;otitis syndrome</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">&#173;children with <span class="bullet-list-last_bullet-list_italic">Haemophilus</span> conjunctivitis</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids</span> and drops that combine corticosteroids with antibiotics for treatment of acute infectious conjunctivitis may be considered in cases of moderate to severe inflammation. Complications associated with topical &#173;steroid use, including elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma, and cataracts, can be minimized by administering a short course of treatment (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>2 weeks).</p>
					<p class="h3">Hyperacute gonococcal conjunctivitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The organism most commonly responsible for hyperacute conjunctivitis is <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae.</span> Other sexually transmitted pathogens that can cause conjunctivitis include <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum,</span> HIV, <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis,</span> and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-7">&#173;Table&#160;12-7</span>).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Gonococcal conjunctivitis is a severe purulent form of conjunctivitis characterized by explosive onset and very rapid progression, with signs of massive exudation, severe chemosis, eyelid edema, marked conjunctival hyperemia, and in untreated cases, corneal infiltrates, melting, and perforation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-4">Figs&#160;12-4</span>, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-5">12-5</span>). Gonococcal conjunctivitis is one of the few bacterial diseases that is associated with preauricular lymphadenopathy and the formation of conjunctival membranes. Keratitis, the principal cause of sight-&#173;threatening complications, occurs in 15% to 40% of cases. Corneal involvement may consist of diffuse epithelial haze, epithelial defects, marginal infiltrates, and ulcerative keratitis that can pro&#173;gress rapidly to perforation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Gonococcal conjunctivitis is a sexually transmitted disease that results from direct transmission of the organism. Modes of transmission include from the genitalia to the hands and then to the eyes or from the &#173;mother to the neonate during vaginal delivery.</p>

Ceftriaxone, a third-&#173;generation cephalosporin, is highly effective against PRNG. Patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis without corneal ulceration may be treated on an outpatient basis with 1 intramuscular (IM) injection of ceftriaxone (1&#160;g); patients with corneal ulceration should be admitted to the hospital and treated intravenously (IV) with ceftriaxone (1&#160;g IV &#173;every 12 hours) for 3 consecutive days. Patients with penicillin allergy may receive spectinomycin (2&#160;g IM) or oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 500&#160;mg or ofloxacin 400&#160;mg orally twice daily for 5 days). When pos&#173;si&#173;ble, fluoroquinolones should be avoided in &#173;children &#173;because of potential adverse effects on joint cartilage.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Topical ointments containing erythromycin, bacitracin, or gentamicin as well as ciprofloxacin solution may be considered as supplemental therapeutic options. In severe cases, the recommended approach is copious, frequent irrigation (&#173;every 30–60 minutes) of the conjunctival sac with normal saline to remove inflammatory cells, proteases, and debris that may be toxic to the ocular surface and contribute to corneal melting.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Evidence suggests that up to one-&#173;third of patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis have concurrent chlamydial venereal disease. For this reason, it is recommended that patients receive supplemental oral antibiotics for treatment of chlamydial infection. Patients should be advised to refer their sex partners for evaluation and treatment. In nonneonatal &#173;children with gonococcal or chlamydial infections, sexual abuse should be considered.

The discharge may be serosanguineous during the first several days, with subsequent development of copious purulent exudate, severe corneal complications, and endophthalmitis. Infected infants may have additional localized gonococcal infections, including rhinitis and proctitis.

Trachoma is endemic in the &#173;Middle East and in resource-&#173;limited regions around the world. In the United States, trachoma occurs sporadically among Native American populations and in residents of mountainous areas of the Southeast. Most infections are transmitted from eye to eye, but transmission also is pos&#173;si&#173;ble by flies or &#173;house&#173;hold fomites.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The symptoms of trachoma include foreign-&#173;body sensation, redness, tearing, and mucopurulent discharge. &#173;These are followed by a severe follicular reaction, which occurs predominantly in the superior palpebral conjunctiva and sometimes in the superior and inferior fornices, inferior palpebral conjunctiva, semilunar fold, and limbus. In acute trachoma, follicles on the superior tarsus may be obscured by diffuse papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory cell infiltration. Large tarsal follicles in trachoma may become necrotic, eventually healing with significant scarring. Linear or stellate scarring of the superior tarsus <span class="h5-text_italic">(Arlt line)</span> is common in &#173;these cases (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-6">Fig&#160;12-6</span>). Involution and necrosis of follicles may result in limbal depressions known as <span class="h5-text_italic">Herbert pits</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-7">Fig&#160;12-7</span>). Corneal findings in trachoma include the following:</p>

					<p class="body-text">Chronic trachoma can also result in tear-&#173;drainage obstruction, trichiasis, and entropion. The World Health &#173;Organization (WHO) has devised a &#173;simple grading system for trachoma severity based on the presence or absence of 5 key signs (see text box). This grading system was developed for trained personnel, other than ophthalmologists, to assess the prevalence and severity of trachoma by means of findings from population-&#173;based surveys in endemic areas.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The primary mode of diagnosis of trachoma is based on clinical manifestations in endemic areas. As an obligate intracellular pathogen, <span class="h5-text_italic">C trachomatis</span> cannot be easily isolated by standard ophthalmic culture techniques and instead requires &#173;either direct observation of the intracellular bacterium or cell culture. Direct visualization is pos&#173;si&#173;ble by Giemsa staining or direct fluo&#173;rescent antibody staining. PCR probes are available for this purpose and are increasingly being used in place of other diagnostic methods.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The&#160;WHO, in conjunction with the International Trachoma Initiative, has implemented the SAFE strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement) for prevention and treatment of trachoma. As a result, the incidence of trachoma has decreased significantly in the &#173;Middle East and in North Africa.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Surgery is used to address the in-&#173;turned eyelashes of patients with trichiasis or entropion. Antibiotic treatment may include 1 of the following options:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">oral azithromycin 1000&#160;mg, given as a single dose (preferred regimen)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">oral tetracycline, 1.5&#160;g to 2.0&#160;g, daily in divided doses for 3 weeks</li>

					<p class="body-text">The lack of facial cleanliness is strongly correlated with spread of trachoma; &#173;children with poor facial hygiene are more likely to acquire or transmit the disease.

Keratitis is more likely to be found in the superior cornea but may also occur centrally and resemble adenoviral keratitis. A micropannus, usually extending less than 3&#160;mm from the superior cornea, may develop (Fig&#160;12-8). The laboratory workup is as described in the previous section.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Left untreated, adult chlamydial conjunctivitis often resolves spontaneously in 6 to 18 months. The following oral antibiotic regimens are commonly used:</p>

					<p class="body-text">Testing of Gram-&#173; and Giemsa-&#173;stained conjunctival scrapings is recommended in cases of neonatal conjunctivitis to identify <span class="italic">C trachomatis</span> and <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae,</span> as well as other bacteria, as causative agents. Other <span class="italic">Chlamydia</span>-&#173;associated infections, such as pneumonitis and otitis media, may accompany inclusion conjunctivitis in neonates. Therefore, treatment with systemic erythromycin (12.5&#160;mg/kg oral or IV 4 times daily for 14 days) is recommended. Topical erythromycin ointment may be used in addition to but not as a replacement for oral therapy.

					<p class="h2">Parinaud Oculoglandular Syndrome</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Granulomatous conjunctivitis with regional lymphadenopathy is an uncommon condition also known as <span class="italic">Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome. Cat-&#173;scratch disease (CSD),</span> which precedes most cases of the syndrome, is estimated to affect 22,000 &#173;people annually in the United States, with conjunctivitis developing in approximately 10%. The primary causative agent of CSD is <span class="italic">Bartonella henselae.</span> Other causative organisms include <span class="italic">Mycobacterium </span><span class="italic">tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, T&#160;</span><span class="italic">pallidum,</span> and <span class="italic">C trachomatis.</span></p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In&#160;CSD, unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis develops approximately 3 to 10 days &#173;after inoculation, with 1 or more raised or flat gelatinous, hyperemic, granulomatous lesions on the superior or inferior palpebral conjunctiva, fornix, or bulbar conjunctiva. &#173;Either concurrently or 1 to 2 weeks &#173;later, the ipsilateral preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes, and occasionally the cervical nodes, become firm and tender. Approximately 10% to 40% of the nodes enlarge and become suppurative. Mild systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, headache, and anorexia develop in about 10% to 30% of patients, with severe, disseminated complications—&#173;including encephalopathy, encephalitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, osteolysis, hepatitis, and splenitis—&#173;occurring in approximately 2% of patients with CSD. Optic neuritis and neuroretinitis have also been reported infrequently.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> <span class="h5-text_italic">B henselae</span> is usually transmitted by infected fleas to cats (especially kittens), its natu&#173;ral reservoir. Feline infection may be transient or may persist asymptomatically. Despite the name “cat-&#173;scratch” disease, scratches are not the only route of inoculation in &#173;humans; infection also may be transmitted by a bite or lick or by contact with the cat’s fleas. Human-&#173;to-&#173;human transmission is not known to occur. Local infection &#173;causes a granulomatous reaction.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Serologic testing is the most cost-&#173;effective means of diagnosing typical CSD. Antibodies to <span class="h5-text_italic">B henselae</span> can be detected by indirect fluo&#173;rescent antibody testing or enzyme immunoassay. The latter is more sensitive and is available from specialty laboratories. A skin-&#173;test antigen for CSD is neither commercially available nor standardized. Aty&#173;pi&#173;cal CSD is best approached by combining serologic testing with culture or PCR.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> No ideal treatment for CSD has been determined, but some success has been noted with certain antibacterial treatment regimens, including azithromycin, erythromycin, and doxycycline.

The use of disposable lenses for extended-&#173;wear and high–&#173;oxygen permeable silicone CL material did not appear to prevent microbial keratitis. Daily disposable soft CL use is felt by many clinicians to be the safest regimen. Poor CL hygiene is also a significant risk &#173;factor for microbial keratitis.

Some cases involve a more intense inflammatory response characterized by dense, suppurative stromal inflammation with indistinct edges and surrounding edema and stromal cells, even several millimeters away from the infiltrate (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-10">Fig&#160;12-10</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> typically &#173;causes stromal necrosis and adherent mucopurulent exudate (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-11">Fig&#160;12-11</span>). An endothelial inflammatory plaque, marked anterior chamber reaction, and hypopyon are also common in bacterial keratitis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-12">Fig&#160;12-12</span>). The hypopyon can be subtle early on; it may be found nasally or temporally, if the patient has been lying down.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Patients with infections caused by slow-&#173;growing, fastidious organisms, such as mycobacteria or anaerobes, may have a nonsuppurative infiltrate and an intact epithelium. <span class="italic">Infectious crystalline keratopathy,</span> for example, pre&#173;sents as densely packed, white or crystalline, branching, snowflake-&#173;like aggregates with almost no host inflammatory response &#173;because the microorganisms are shielded by a biofilm. Risk &#173;factors for this condition include corticosteroid use, CL wear, and previous corneal surgery with or without retained sutures. Infectious crystalline keratopathy has been attributed to vari&#173;ous bacterial and fungal agents, most commonly <span class="greek">α</span>-&#173;hemolytic <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-13">Fig&#160;12-13</span>).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Corneal pathogens adhere first to the corneal surface and then invade and proliferate in the corneal stroma. Certain risk &#173;factors tend to be selective for specific pathogens, based on the pathogen’s mechanism of adherence. For example, <span class="h5-text_italic">P aeruginosa</span> is more pathogenic in CL-&#173;related biofilms, in which binding to receptors on injured epithelial cells is facilitated. &#173;After adherence, infiltration of the corneal stroma occurs, often mediated by bacteria proteases. The host responds with inflammation, comprising cytokine and chemokine expression, recruitment of inflammatory cells from the tears and limbal vessels, and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, which result in characteristic corneal necrosis. Reduction of bacterial load and direct control of the inflammatory response are interventions aimed at decreasing keratolysis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> For bacterial keratitis, the clinical appearance of the infection is not a reliable indicator of the causative pathogen.

					<p class="body-text">In addition to culturing corneal specimens, it may be helpful to culture samples obtained from CLs, CL cases and solutions, and any other potential sources of contamination, such as inflamed eyelids. The microbial yield in specimens collected for corneal cultures and smears is significantly higher before the initiation of antibiotic treatment, but specimens should still be cultured in cases of treatment failure. Some have suggested that antibiotics be discontinued for 12 to 24 hours to increase the yield of the pathogen. Positive results of a smear do not obviate broad-&#173;spectrum coverage but may guide coverage &#173;toward a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent class of microorganism in the absence of positive culture findings.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The primary goal of therapy is preservation of sight and of corneal integrity. Bacterial pathogens can cause irreversible corneal scarring over a period of hours &#173;because of their rapid proliferation, keratolytic enzyme activity, and stimulation of destructive host immune responses. To reduce bacterial load and minimize risk of vision loss, initiation of therapy is advised before a definitive diagnosis is obtained (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 12-9">&#173;Table&#160;12-9</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Initial therapy</span> consists of empiric, broad-&#173;spectrum topical antibiotics. In routine corneal ulcers, topical fluoroquinolone monotherapy has excellent penetration at commercially available concentrations, and the outcomes achieved are equivalent to &#173;those with combination therapy. The recommended regimen for fluoroquinolones is &#173;every 30 to 60 minutes initially and then tapering in frequency according to the clinical response. In severe cases, administration of antibiotics &#173;every 5 minutes for 30 minutes as a loading dose may be considered.

					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fortified antibiotics</span> (compounded at higher concentrations than the commercially available counter&#173;parts) may be administered for severe ulcers when increased drug concentration in the corneal stroma is desired. Fortified antibiotics generally are difficult to obtain and have greater toxicity. Fortified vancomycin may be considered for gram-&#173;positive coverage of large or vision-&#173;threatening ulcers, when MRSA is suspected, or &#173;after failure of the initial therapy. With effective treatment, most infectious keratitis cases &#173;will have negative culture results by 48 to 72 hours. Once the offending microbe is identified or &#173;there is clinical improvement, appropriate monotherapy may be considered (see <span class="xref-table-local">&#173;Table&#160;12-9</span>) to reduce toxicity while maintaining coverage. Continued administration of fortified antibiotics beyond 7 days is not advisable &#173;because of increased toxicity. At times, bacterial keratitis improves with antibiotic therapy even when in vitro data suggest &#173;resistance of the causative agent to that antibiotic. Therefore, the clinical response should guide the choice of medical therapy.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Systemic antibiotics,</span> especially fluoroquinolones, and intensive topical antibiotics are indicated in cases with suspected scleral and/or intraocular extension of infection but generally are not used in routine cases of bacterial keratitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">The role of</span> <span class="italic">corticosteroid therapy</span> for bacterial keratitis remains controversial. Tissue destruction results from a combination of the direct effects of the bacteria and the host inflammatory response, including the release of proteolytic enzymes, which persist &#173;after corneal sterilization. Corticosteroids are effective at controlling inflammation but inhibit the host response to infection. The lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture strongly suggests that corticosteroid therapy administered <span class="italic">before</span> appropriate antibiotic therapy worsens prognosis. In a randomized clinical trial (Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial [SCUT]) in which topical corticosteroids &#173;were given 48 hours &#173;after initiation of topical antibiotics for bacterial keratitis, no effect on final visual outcome or complication rate was seen at 3 months. &#173;There &#173;were trends &#173;toward improved outcomes in patients with the poorest vision at baseline who received corticosteroids and for the entire corticosteroid group at 1 year. In this study, cases of keratitis caused by <span class="italic">Nocardia,</span> which is uncommon in the United States, had worse outcomes with corticosteroid treatment.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Although corticosteroid use is unsupported, it generally does not increase the risk of poor outcomes or complications in treated bacterial keratitis, and certain patients benefit from the addition of corticosteroids to antibiotic therapy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The following are recommendations for conditions of bacterial keratitis in which corticosteroid therapy should not be given:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">in the absence of appropriate antibiotic therapy</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">if the patient is unable to return for frequent follow-up or adhere to antibiotic therapy</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">if any virulent or difficult-&#173;to-&#173;eradicate organism is found or suspected</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Corticosteroid drops may be started 48 hours &#173;after initiation of antibiotic therapy and &#173;after identification of the causative organism. If the patient experiences no adverse effects, the frequency of administration may be adjusted on the basis of the clinical response. If a patient on long-&#173;term topical &#173;steroid therapy pre&#173;sents with bacterial keratitis, the corticosteroids should be decreased, with an expectation of increased inflammation. If fungal or <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> infection is suspected, corticosteroids should be &#173;stopped. Additional &#173;measures, including lubrication, &#173;bandage contact lenses, and taping the eyelids closed, may be needed to promote reepithelialization and reduce keratolysis. Collagen crosslinking may be considered as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis; however, &#173;there is not sufficient evidence to support its use in primary management of bacterial keratitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Surgical treatment</span> of bacterial keratitis is indicated if the disease progresses despite therapy or is other&#173;wise unresponsive to therapy—or if descemetocele formation or perforation occurs. Lamellar keratoplasty (LK) may be preferable to penetrating keratoplasty (PK) &#173;because LK is associated with lower risk of intraocular seeding of infection, formation of peripheral anterior synechiae, glaucoma, and cataract formation associated with entering the anterior chamber. Descemetocele and perforations smaller than 2&#160;mm may be managed with tissue adhesive as a therapeutic modality (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>). <span class="keypoint_underline">Amniotic membrane grafting is not recommended for sole management when the infection has not resolved significantly, when the causative organism has not been clearly identified, or when a corneal perforation is pre&#173;sent.</span> Peripheral iridectomy should be performed during PK &#173;because extensive synechiae may develop from inflammatory membranes. Interrupted sutures are recommended, and the patient should be given appropriate topical antibiotics and cycloplegia. &#173;There is disagreement about topical corticosteroid use &#173;after keratoplasty, particularly if the bacterial infection has not been controlled. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> in this volume for a more detailed discussion of LK and PK and BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> for an in-&#173;depth discussion of ocular pharmacology.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Systemic treatment may be considered for severe keratitis or keratitis with scleral or intracameral extension. Ketoconazole (200–600&#160;mg/day), fluconazole (200–400&#160;mg/day), or itraconazole (200&#160;mg/day) may be used, but oral voriconazole (200–400&#160;mg/day) and posaconazole (800&#160;mg/day) have excellent intraocular penetration and broad coverage and have increasingly supplanted &#173;these older drugs. Alternatively, intrastromal injection of aqueous-&#173;soluble amphotericin B (5–10&#160;<span class="greek">µg</span>/0.1&#160;mL) or voriconazole (50–100&#160;<span class="greek">µg</span>/0.1&#160;mL) as primary or secondary treatment of deep fungal keratitis, and intracameral injection of &#173;either agent for intraocular extension, are becoming more widely validated.

Penetration of natamycin or amphotericin&#160;B can be enhanced by debridement of the corneal epithelium.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> is a genus of free-&#173;living ubiquitous protozoa found in fresh &#173;water and soil. Freezing, desiccation, and typical chlorine levels in municipal &#173;water supplies, swimming pools, and hot tubs are not sufficient to kill <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span>. Ocular exposure to well &#173;water and swimming in fresh &#173;water or ponds while wearing contact lenses increases risk of infection. <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> may exist as motile trophozoites or dormant cysts. In Western countries, approximately 90% of reported cases of amebic keratitis have been associated with contact lens use, with the remainder linked to vari&#173;ous other risk &#173;factors. Historically, episodic outbreaks of disease have been associated with &#173;water contamination, such as homemade saline contact lens solutions, groundwater affected by river flooding, or contaminated rooftop cisterns.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Diagnosis of <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis is made by visualizing amebae in stained smears (eg, Giemsa, periodic acid–&#173;Schiff, calcofluor white, acridine orange) or by culturing organisms obtained from corneal scrapings on nonnutrient agar with overlay of <span class="h5-text_italic">E coli</span> or <span class="h5-text_italic">Enterobacter aerogenes</span>. Buffered charcoal–&#173;yeast agar also may be used as a substrate. In culture, characteristic trails form as the motile trophozoites travel across the surface of the plate. In vivo confocal microscopy can be performed to visualize <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> cysts (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-19">Fig&#160;12-19</span>). Culture yield varies among laboratories, with findings of large studies indicating only 35% to 50% positivity for <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> despite suggestive clinical &#173;presentation or findings on confocal microscopy. Examination of contact lenses and related paraphernalia may be advisable. Lamellar corneal biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Early diagnosis of <span class="h5-text_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis is the most impor&#173;tant indicator of a good prognosis. However, diagnostic delay is common &#173;because of the nonspecific &#173;presentation of the disease and the specialized microbiological methods needed for diagnosis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Cases identified early, which are defined as epithelial or anterior stromal, have an excellent visual prognosis and generally respond well to epithelial debridement, followed by a 3-&#173; to 4-&#173;month course of antiamebic therapy. <span class="keypoint_underline">Findings of deep stromal inflammation, a ring infiltrate, or extracorneal manifestations worsen the prognosis and often require longer treatment (a year or more), other adjunctive therapy, or therapeutic keratoplasty.</span> </p>

					<p class="body-text">Oral miltefosine (65&#160;<span class="greek">µg</span>/mL, 28 days), an FDA-&#173;approved treatment for <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis, is used in refractory cases. Miltefosine is presumed to interfere with the mitochondrial function and membrane integrity of the amebae. Common adverse reactions include ocular redness and inflammation (keratitis, scleritis, uveitis), which can be severe and cause extreme visual impairment. Miltefosine has caused gout to occur in individuals with a history of the condition.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Several other antimicrobial agents have been recommended for medical treatment of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis on the basis of their in vitro amebicidal effects and their clinical effectiveness. Topical agents include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">diamidines:</span> propamidine, hexamidine</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">biguanides:</span> polyhexamethylene biguanide (polyhexanide), chlorhexidine</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">aminoglycosides:</span> neomycin, paromomycin</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">imidazoles/triazoles:</span> voriconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">The biguanides have consistent in vitro and clinical efficacy against cysts and trophozoites; the other agents are effective primarily against trophozoites. Thus, biguanides are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of <span class="bullet-list_italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis. Diamidines may be given early in the course of therapy, but resolution of the infection can be achieved with a biguanide alone. In a comparison of biguanides, chlorhexidine 0.02% and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02% performed similarly. Single-&#173;agent systemic treatment with voriconazole may be effective in recalcitrant cases. Corticosteroid exposure induces acanthamoebal excystment in vitro, and corticosteroids may worsen clinical outcomes when used before effective anti-&#173;acanthamoebal therapy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Much of the morbidity of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis, including scleritis, glaucoma, and cataract, can be attributed to the exuberant host response. The judicious use of topical and systemic immunosuppressants may be beneficial &#173;after the patient has received anti-&#173;acanthamoebal therapy for at least 2 weeks.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Traditionally, keratoplasty has been reserved for vision rehabilitation &#173;after completion of treatment or for cases that pro&#173;gress despite maximal medical therapy and are at risk of perforation. Recent peer-&#173;reviewed lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture has indicated that LK and PK may reduce the rate of recurrent infection and improve visual outcomes when combined with adjunctive anti-&#173;acanthamoebal agents. However, medical treatment is preferred in the vast majority of cases. It is advisable to perform optical keratoplasty only &#173;after a full course of amebicidal therapy &#173;because recurrence is pos&#173;si&#173;ble when medical therapy is ended prematurely. Corneal crosslinking is not currently recommended for the treatment of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis &#173;because of efficacy concerns.</p>

					<p class="h3">Microsporidiosis</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Based on the patient’s immune status, 1 of 2 &#173;presentations of microsporidial infection may occur. Immunocompetent individuals may experience corneal stromal keratitis, whereas &#173;those who are immunocompromised (particularly &#173;those with AIDS) may have conjunctivitis and epithelial keratopathy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-20">Fig&#160;12-20</span>). Immunocompromised patients may also have disseminated microsporidiosis involving the sinuses, respiratory tract, or gastrointestinal tract.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Common symptoms include ocular irritation, photophobia, decreased vision, and bilateral conjunctival hyperemia with &#173;little or no associated inflammation. Depending on the genus of the microsporidium, the condition may manifest as stromal keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis. In the keratoconjunctivitis variant, corneal findings include superficial nonstaining opacities described as “mucoid” in appearance, dense areas of fine punctate fluorescein staining, and a clear corneal stroma, with minimal or no iritis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Microsporidia are intracellular protozoa known to cause ocular infection. Initially recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in individuals with immunosuppression, this organism is increasingly being identified as the cause of infection in immunocompetent persons, especially in Southeast Asia. Deep stromal infection may pre&#173;sent as chronic, progressive keratitis in immunocompetent patients.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Microsporidosis-&#173;positive conjunctival biopsy specimens stained with Brown and Hopps solution and visualized with light microscopy exhibit small gram-&#173;positive spores in epithelial cells (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-21">Fig&#160;12-21</span>). Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence antibody techniques, or elaborate tissue culture techniques may also be used for evaluation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Restoration of immune function can lead to resolution of microsporidial keratitis. Although &#173;there is no definitive treatment, topical fumagillin has been used successfully for microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis, with &#173;little toxic effect. Topical treatment with voriconazole 1% and oral itraconazole 200&#160;mg 2 times per day may also be effective. In severe infection, granulomatous inflammation may lead to necrotic thinning and perforation requiring PK. Medical therapy generally must be prolonged, and recurrence is common &#173;after treatment discontinuation. Topical fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 0.3%, moxifloxacin 0.5%, gatifloxacin 0.5%, levofloxacin 0.5%, and norfloxacin 0.3%) as monotherapy or in combination with topical fumagillin or systemic albendazole have been effective for the treatment of microsporidial keratitis, with resolution in 99% of cases even on topical fluoroquinolone monotherapy.</p>

					<p class="h2">Loiasis: Nematodes</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infection with <span class="italic">Loa loa</span> (loiasis) and other filarial nematodes can result in conjunctivitis and dermatologic manifestations. The microfilarial stage of the parasite is transmitted from &#173;human to &#173;human by the bite of an infected female deerfly indigenous to West and Central Africa. A migrating worm burrows subcutaneously at approximately 1&#160;cm/min but is most con&#173;spic&#173;u&#173;ous when it is seen or felt wriggling &#173;under the periocular skin or bulbar conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-22">Fig&#160;12-22</span>). Extraction of the filarial worm cures the conjunctivitis; antiparasitic treatment then is administered for disseminated infestation. Concurrent administration of corticosteroids and/or antihistamines may be necessary to minimize allergic reactions.</p>
					<p class="h2">Microbial Scleritis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial and fungal infections of the sclera are rare. Most cases result from the extension of microbial keratitis involving the peripheral cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 12-23">Fig&#160;12-23)</span>. Trauma and exposure to contaminated foreign bodies (including scleral buckles) are pos&#173;si&#173;ble risk &#173;factors. Bacterial scleritis may manifest in sclera damaged by previous pterygium surgery, especially when beta irradiation or mitomycin has been used. Bacteria and fungi can also invade tissue of the eye wall surrounding a scleral surgical wound, often leading to endophthalmitis. Scleral inflammation may accompany syphilis, tuberculosis, or leprosy, as well as infection with <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> species, <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species, or aty&#173;pi&#173;cal mycobacteria. Tuberculous scleritis should be considered in chronic steroid-&#173;dependent scleritis or in surgically induced necrotizing scleritis. Diffuse or nodular scleritis is an occasional complication of ocular infection with varicella-&#173;zoster virus.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Suppurative scleritis can be assessed in the same manner as microbial keratitis. Antimicrobial therapy can be initiated &#173;after results of smears and cultures are obtained. If the overlying epithelium is intact, obtaining a scleral or episcleral biopsy specimen is recommended for culture, histologic examination, and molecular diagnostic testing. The workup of nonsuppurative scleritis is guided by the history and by findings from the examination.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Topical antimicrobial therapy is the same as for microbial keratitis. &#173;Because of the difficulty in controlling microbial scleritis, subconjunctival injections and intravenous antibiotics may also be used. Results of long-&#173;term oral therapy have been favorable.</p>
