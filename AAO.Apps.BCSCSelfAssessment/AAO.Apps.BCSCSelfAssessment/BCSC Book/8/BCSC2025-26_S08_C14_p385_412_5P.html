				<div id="Chapt14_Top1">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular surface tumors of the conjunctiva and cornea are considered together in this book &#173;because the lesions can affect both tissues concurrently. &#173;These lesions are classified by cell type: epithelium, neuroectodermal (melanocytes, nevus cells, neural and other cells), vascular endothelium, mesenchymal cells, and lymphocytes. Many are analogous to lesions affecting the eyelid. Ocular surface tumors are associated with a spectrum of conditions, from benign to premalignant to malignant neoplasia, often with similar clinical appearance and &#173;presentation. Histologic examination may be needed for definitive diagnosis. <span class="keypoint_underline">The most common malignant tumors of the ocular surface are squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and lymphoma.</span> </p>

			<p class="h1">Approach to the Patient With a Neoplastic Ocular Surface Lesion</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top2">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During the initial evaluation of a patient with a conjunctival or corneal neoplasm, it is impor&#173;tant to obtain a detailed history, including sun exposure, prior skin cancer, and immunosuppression. The clinician should inquire about the duration of the lesion and changes in its appearance. The racial or ethnic background of the patient is relevant; conjunctival pigmentation may be normal in darker-&#173;skinned individuals but cause for concern in individuals with fair skin.</p>
					<p class="body-text">During the initial evaluation of the patient with a suspicious ocular surface lesion, a complete eye examination, including a dilated fundus examination, is warranted. It is impor&#173;tant to examine the entire ocular surface, including the superior fornix, which requires eyelid eversion. <span class="keypoint_underline">Palpation for lymphadenopathy in the neck and preauricular region is an impor&#173;tant part of the examination of patients with tumors,</span> especially when malignancy is suspected, &#173;because malignant lesions (eg, conjunctival melanoma) can spread to regional lymph nodes. It is essential to note the clinical characteristics of the lesion (see text box).</p>

					<p class="body-text">Also, it is impor&#173;tant to document the appearance and extent of the lesion, using &#173;either photo&#173;graphs or a detailed diagram. Documentation aids in surgical planning if the lesion is to be removed or in following the lesion if observation is recommended.</p>
				</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Management of Patients With Ocular Surface Tumors</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following sections describe the generally accepted approaches and princi&#173;ples in the management of patients with ocular surface tumors.</p>
					<p class="h2">Observation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After completing the history and physical examination, an experienced clinician usually has an opinion about the nature of a conjunctival or corneal lesion. Many lesions are not suggestive of malignancy (eg, inclusion cysts); &#173;others &#173;will be indeterminate on the basis of the history and clinical examination findings. For &#173;these cases, observation may be a reasonable option. If the clinician decides to observe, regular (annual or more frequent) ophthalmic examinations are essential. Slit-&#173;lamp photography can be used to document the appearance of a lesion at a point in time and assess for changes. If growth or suspicious changes in the lesion are noted, surgery or topical chemotherapy is usually indicated. Tissue for histologic evaluation may be required for definitive diagnosis. Findings that raise concern for malignancy in such lesions include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">enlargement of the lesion and changes in border appearance</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">elevation</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">extensive pigmentation, even if the lesion is flat</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">fixation to under&#173;lying tissues</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">large feeder vessel</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">“Optical biopsy” using noninvasive imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>, Fig&#160;6-4, and BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>), confocal microscopy, or ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) may assist the clinician in deciding &#173;whether to continue observation or proceed with surgical excision, chemotherapy, or other treatment options.</p>

					<p class="h2">Surgery</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgical resection has been the traditional approach to the treatment of ocular surface tumors. <span class="keypoint_underline">The advantages of surgical excision include providing tissue for definitive histologic diagnosis; confirmation of clear margins; immediate results; fewer issues related to patient adherence to a therapeutic regimen; and in some cases, cost efficiency due to fewer medi&#173;cations and office visits compared with alternative treatments.</span> Potential disadvantages of surgical excision include incomplete treatment of microscopic, subclinical disease, as well as scarring and symblepharon. If more than two-&#173;thirds of the limbal epithelium is removed, stem cell deficiency and chronic epitheliopathy may result. Stem cell transplantation using tissue harvested from the fellow eye or an allograft may eventually be required (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>).</p>

							<!--<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="BCSC2025-26_S08_C14_p385_412_5P-web-resources/image/bcsc-2025-26-keypoint-icon-interior.jpg" alt="" />-->
						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="body-text">Princi&#173;ples of surgical excision of an ocular surface tumor that may be malignant are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">Perform a complete excision with 2-mm to 4-mm clear margins.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Use the “no-&#173;touch” technique to avoid touching the tumor during removal in order to prevent tumor seeding.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">Administer double freeze–&#173;thaw cryotherapy to surrounding conjunctival and limbal margins and apply absolute alcohol or cryotherapy to involved and surrounding corneal epithelium for squamous cell or melanocytic tumors.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">A conjunctival tumor should be evaluated by an ophthalmic pathologist &#173;because diagnoses in &#173;these cases can be challenging, especially for less experienced clinicians. Once removed, the lesion can be placed on filter paper and the edges labeled with ink or suture to indicate the orientation of the lesion, which is helpful to the pathologist. The surgeon should take care to avoid damage to the specimen during removal, which could make histologic assessment of the lesion more difficult. Immunostaining can help in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. The clinical history is relevant to the pathologist’s interpretation; thus, the label should include the age and race or ethnicity of the patient, the duration of the lesion, and &#173;whether the lesion has changed clinically. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of specimen &#173;handling and histologic examination.</p>

					<p class="h2">Topical Chemotherapy</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical chemotherapy may be used as an alternative to surgical excision for primary treatment of ocular surface tumors or as adjunctive therapy preceding or following surgical excision. <span class="keypoint_underline">Topical chemotherapy has the advantage of treating beyond areas of clinically vis&#173;i&#173;ble involvement, but unlike surgical excision, it does not provide the opportunity for histologic diagnosis or the determination of clear margins.</span> </p>

					<p class="body-text">Controlled studies have not yet determined the optimal chemotherapy regimen for each tumor cell type. First-&#173;line therapy for ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) consists of <span class="italic">&#173;either</span> 5-&#173;FU or MMC (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-1">Figs&#160;14-1</span>, <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-2">14-2</span>). Melanocytic tumors are less likely to resolve with topical chemotherapy and may be more responsive to MMC than 5-&#173;FU.</p>
					<p class="h2">Other Treatment Options</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immunomodulatory agents (eg, rituximab) and radiotherapy are effective treatments for ocular lymphoid tumors. Additional treatment options for ocular surface tumors are evolving and depend on the cell type. They include radioimmunotherapy, targeted gene therapy, and checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
					<p class="h2">Treatment Follow-&#173;Up</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Once a tumor has been managed, long-&#173;term (annual or more frequent) follow-up is essential &#173;because ocular surface tumors can recur. It is impor&#173;tant to perform a complete examination of the ocular surface and palpation of regional lymph nodes at each visit. <span class="keypoint_underline">Patients with malignant epithelial or melanocytic ocular surface tumors should be referred to a dermatologist for a complete skin evaluation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-3">Fig&#160;14-3</span>).</span> </p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival squamous papilloma has 2 forms, sessile and pedunculated, and they differ etiologically, histologically, and clinically. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for discussion of the histologic findings.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> A <span class="h5-text_italic">pedunculated</span> papilloma is a fleshy, exophytic growth with a fibrovascular core (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-4">Fig&#160;14-4A</span>). It often arises in the inferior fornix but can also pre&#173;sent on the palpebral (tarsal) or bulbar conjunctiva or along the plica semilunaris. The lesion emanates from a stalk and has a multilobulated appearance with smooth, clear epithelium and numerous under&#173;lying small corkscrew blood vessels. Multiple lesions can occur, and the lesion may be extensive in patients with compromised immunity.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">sessile</span> papilloma is typically found at the limbus and has a flat base (Fig&#160;14-4B). With its glistening surface and numerous red dots, this form of papilloma resembles a strawberry. The lesion may spread onto the cornea. Signs of dysplasia include leukoplakia (indicative of keratinization), symblepharon formation, inflammation, and invasion.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> <span class="h5-text_italic">&#173;Human papillomavirus (HPV),</span> subtypes 6 and 11 (in &#173;children) or 16 (in adults), may initiate a neoplastic growth of epithelial cells with vascular proliferation that gives rise to a pedunculated conjunctival papilloma. A sessile lesion, though also usually benign, may represent a dysplastic or carcinomatous lesion, especially when caused by HPV subtypes 16, 18, or 33. HPV vaccination may be preventive.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> A pedunculated papilloma that is small, cosmetically acceptable, and nonirritating may be observed; spontaneous resolution can occur over many months to years. Surgical excision with cryotherapy or cautery to the base of the lesion is curative in approximately 90% of cases. However, an incomplete excision can stimulate growth and lead to a worse cosmetic outcome. Surgical manipulation should be minimized to reduce the risk of dissemination of the virus to uninvolved healthy conjunctiva. In cases of extensive or recalcitrant lesions, adjunctive treatment with oral cimetidine, which works through an immune-&#173;mediated pathway, may be beneficial. MMC has also been utilized.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A sessile limbal papilloma must be observed closely or excised. If the lesion enlarges or shows clinical features suggesting dysplastic or carcinomatous growth, excisional biopsy with adjunctive cryotherapy is indicated.</p>

Although histologic invasion of the epithelial basement membrane is pre&#173;sent, growth usually remains superficial, with neoplastic cells infrequently penetrating the sclera or Bowman layer. Conjunctival pigmentation can occur in individuals with darker skin. Engorged conjunctival vessels suggest malignancy.

It arises from the sebaceous glands, such as the meibomian glands, glands of Zeis, and the glands of the caruncle. Sebaceous carcinoma usually occurs in individuals older than 50&#160;years but may be seen in youn&#173;ger persons &#173;after radiation therapy. <span class="keypoint_underline">&#173;These tumors may masquerade as chalazia or as chronic unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-9">Fig&#160;14-9</span>).</span> Consequently, more than 50% of cases are initially misdiagnosed. Epithelial invasion of the conjunctiva occurs in almost 50% of cases and extends onto the cornea in more than 25% of cases.

Mild enlargement associated with hormonal influences can occur during puberty or pregnancy, creating a clinical impression of conjunctival melanoma.

					<p class="body-text">Pure intraepithelial nevi are rare except in &#173;children. On histologic examination, nevi occasionally are very difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Junctional nevi may be difficult to distinguish from primary acquired melanosis. Small epithelial inclusion cysts occur within approximately half of all conjunctival nevi, particularly the compound or subepithelial va&#173;ri&#173;e&#173;ties. Secretion of mucin by goblet cells in the inclusion cysts can cause a nevus to enlarge, giving a false impression of malignant change. Cellular proliferation may induce secondary lymphocytic inflammation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Only a small percentage of conjunctival nevi become malignant; therefore, nevi should not be considered precancerous. They can be followed &#173;every 6–12 months with an examination that includes serial photography or detailed slit-&#173;lamp drawings incorporating dimensional &#173;measurements. Patients should be instructed to periodically inspect the lesion, looking for changes in size, coloration, elevation, or vascularization. Lesions showing suspicious change or growth warrant an excisional biopsy. A biopsy can also be considered for pigmented lesions on the palpebral conjunctiva or cornea or in the fornix, &#173;because nevi are rare in &#173;these locations.</p>

CAM appears as flat, light to dark-&#173;brown conjunctival patches with irregular margins that are most apparent at the limbus and less prominent as CAM extends into the fornix (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-13">Fig&#160;14-13</span>). The pigmentation can also involve the caruncle and palpebral conjunctiva as well as extend into the cornea with streaks or whorls (striate melanokeratosis). Histologic findings consist of hyperpigmentation of the conjunctival basal epithelial cells without atypia or hyperplasia. CAM is bilateral, fairly symmetric, and benign, with &#173;little risk of progression to melanoma. It is impor&#173;tant to differentiate CAM from primary acquired melanosis (see &#173;Table&#160;14-3 earlier in the chapter), which seldom occurs in individuals with darker skin, is usually unilateral or highly asymmetric, and can transform to melanoma.</p>

					<p class="body-text">The most impor&#173;tant finding in predicting progression to melanoma is the presence of cellular atypia, which can be determined only by excisional biopsy for histologic examination and immunohistochemistry. PAM without atypia has &#173;little malignant potential. Patients with &#173;these lesions may be followed up with examination &#173;every 6–12 months. PAM with mild atypia has a minimal risk of malignant transformation but should be followed more closely. <span class="keypoint_underline">PAM with moderate to severe atypia carries a 30% risk of progression to melanoma.</span> In patients with moderate to severe atypia, &#173;every effort should be made to eliminate all conjunctival pigment. If the pigmentation is diffuse and not amenable to complete excision, adjuvant topical chemotherapy with MMC or 5-&#173;FU may be useful to treat the entire ocular surface. Secondary acquired melanosis has no significant risk of progression to melanoma.

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Hemangioma</span> An infantile hemangioma (formerly known as <span class="h4-text_italic">capillary hemangioma</span>) is an unencapsulated hamartomatous growth of proliferating capillary endothelium. It usually pre&#173;sents within the first weeks or months &#173;after birth and may enlarge during the first year of life, &#173;after which it typically regresses spontaneously over the next 3–7&#160;years. The palpebral conjunctiva is frequently involved with an infantile hemangioma of the eyelid. The presence of diffuse hemangiomatosis of the palpebral conjunctiva or conjunctival fornix is suggestive of an orbital infantile hemangioma. Treatment options include observation, systemic or topical propranolol, and intralesional or systemic corticosteroids.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Malformations</span> Vascular malformations include a spectrum of benign lesions that contain anomalous capillary venous, arterial, or lymphatic vessel ele&#173;ments. They can fluctuate in size but typically remain static.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cavernous venous malformations</span> (<span class="italic">CVMs;</span> previously called <span class="italic">cavernous hemangiomas</span>) are the most common primary orbital tumor in adults. They contain dilated congested veins typically encapsulated with a thick fibrosed wall. &#173;Because of this encapsulation, they are more amenable to surgical excision. Isolated CVMs of the bulbar conjunctiva are rare and are more likely to represent extension from adjacent structures.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Nevus flammeus,</span> a congenital lesion described as a port-&#173;wine birthmark, may occur alone or as part of encephalofacial angiomatosis (also called <span class="italic">Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome</span>) and may be associated with vascular hamartomas, secondary glaucoma, and/or leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Some cases result from a pathogenic variant in the gene coding for the vascular endothelial protein receptor for angiopoietin 1, which controls the assembly of perivascular smooth muscle.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ataxia-&#173;telangiectasia</span> (also called <span class="italic">Louis-&#173;Bar syndrome</span>) is primarily associated with epibulbar telangiectasis, cerebellar abnormalities, and immune alterations. In this autosomal recessive disease, the epibulbar and interpalpebral telangiectasia of the arteries lacks an associated lymphatic component. The epibulbar vascular lesions seen in ataxia-&#173;telangiectasia can grow with the patient and the eyeball, but episodes of hemorrhage or swelling do not occur.

The lesion may occur over a chalazion or when minor trauma or surgery stimulates exuberant healing tissue with fibroblasts (granulation tissue) and proliferating capillaries that grow in a radiating pattern. This rapidly growing lesion is red, pedunculated, and smooth (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 14-17">Fig&#160;14-17</span>); it bleeds easily and stains with fluorescein dye.

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Metastatic tumors to the conjunctiva are much less common than &#173;those to the uveal tract and orbit, but such tumors have arisen from cancer of the breast, lung, kidney, and elsewhere, including the skin (cutaneous melanoma). Metastatic lesions to the uveal tract, orbit, or paranasal sinuses can extend into the conjunctiva. Metastases or leukemic infiltrates to the limbus or cornea also occur.</p>
