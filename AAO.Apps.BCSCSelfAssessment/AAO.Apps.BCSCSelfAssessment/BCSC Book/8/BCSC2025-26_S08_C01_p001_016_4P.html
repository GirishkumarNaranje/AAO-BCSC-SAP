				<div id="Chapt1_Top1">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The functions of the eyelid include eye protection, tear distribution, ocular surface cleaning, regulation of light exposure, and contribution to the tear film. Except for fine vellus hairs, the eyelashes (cilia) are the only hairs of the eyelid. Eyelashes catch small particles and work as sensors to stimulate reflex eyelid closure. Blinking results in the secretion of meibum from the meibomian glands and spreads tears across the cornea, flushing away foreign material. Most individuals blink an average of 10–15 times per minute at rest, 20 times per minute or more during a conversation, and as few as 5 times per minute when concentrating (eg, reading). Blink frequency also changes in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent positions of gaze. The orbicularis oculi muscle, which is innervated by cranial nerve (CN) VII, closes the upper and lower eyelids. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle, innervated by CN III, inserts into the tarsal plate and skin and elevates the upper eyelid. The&#160;M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle, innervated by sympathetic nerves, also contributes to upper-&#173;eyelid elevation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-1">Fig&#160;1-1</span>). The inferior tarsal muscle helps retract the lower eyelid.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The epidermis of the eyelids abruptly changes from keratinized to nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium at the mucocutaneous junction of the eyelid margin, along the row of <span class="italic">meibomian gland</span> orifices. Holocrine sebaceous glands and eccrine sweat glands are pre&#173;sent in the eyelid skin. Near the eyelid margin are apocrine sweat glands (the <span class="italic">glands of Moll</span>) and numerous modified sebaceous glands (the <span class="italic">glands of Zeis</span>).</p>

					<p class="body-text">The LFU responds to environmental, endocrinologic, and cortical influences. The afferent component of the LFU is mediated through ocular surface and trigeminal nociceptors, which synapse with the efferent nerves (autonomic and motor nerves) in the brainstem. The autonomic nerve fibers innervate the meibomian glands, conjunctival goblet cells, and lacrimal glands. The motor nerve fibers innervate the orbicularis muscle to initiate blinking. During blinking, the meibomian glands express lipid, and the tears are distributed from the inferior tear meniscus and spread across the cornea while excess tears are directed into the lacrimal puncta.</p>

			<p class="h1">Tear Film</p>
				<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The tear film is currently thought to be a liquid consisting of soluble mucus, aqueous, and liquid lipids and proteins that are contributed by the meibomian glands, lacrimal gland, accessory lacrimal glands, conjunctival goblet cells, and surface epithelium (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-1"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-3">Fig&#160;1-3</span>; see also <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-1</span>). This hydrophilic fluid moves over the glycocalyx of the superficial corneal epithelial cells.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A healthy tear film is critical for both good vision and a healthy eye. Functions of the tear film include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">maintaining lubrication of the corneal surface and a smooth optical interface between blinks</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">contributing to the refractive power of the eye through the air–&#173;tear film interface</li>

			<p class="h1">Conjunctiva</p>
				<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conjunctiva can be broadly divided into 3 geographic zones:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">palpebral,</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">tarsal:</span> starts at the mucocutaneous junction of the upper and lower eyelids and lines the inner eyelid; it is tightly adherent to the under&#173;lying tarsus</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">bulbar:</span> covers the ocular surface of the eye and is loosely attached to the Tenon capsule; it inserts into the limbus</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">forniceal:</span> covers the superior and inferior fornices</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">The accessory lacrimal glands of Krause are located in the fornix of the palpebral conjunctiva, while the accessory glands of Wolfring are located in the subconjunctival tissue, near the upper border of the superior tarsal plate (see <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-1">Fig&#160;1-1A</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">plica semilunaris</span> is a crescent-&#173;shaped vertical fold of conjunctiva, located at the medial &#173;angle of the eye. The <span class="italic">caruncle</span>—&#173;a fleshy, ovoid mass approximately 5&#160;mm high and 3&#160;mm wide—is attached to the inferomedial side of the plica semilunaris and contains goblet cells and lacrimal tissue, as well as hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. This area also contains the tear lake, which resides on the lower eyelid, where tears accumulate &#173;after bathing the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The cell morphology of the conjunctival epithelium varies from stratified cuboidal over the tarsus and columnar in the fornices to squamous on the globe. Goblet cells account for up to 10% of basal cells of the conjunctival epithelium and are most numerous in the palpebral conjunctiva, the inferonasal bulbar conjunctiva, and the area of the plica semilunaris (see Fig&#160;1-1B).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">substantia propria</span> of the conjunctiva consists of loose connective tissue. Conjunctiva-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (CALT), which consists of lymphocytes and other leukocytes, is pre&#173;sent, especially in the fornices. Lymphocytes interact with mucosal epithelial cells through reciprocal regulatory signals mediated by growth &#173;factors, cytokines, and neuropeptides.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The palpebral conjunctiva shares its blood supply with the eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva is supplied by the anterior ciliary arteries, which arise from muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery. &#173;These capillaries are fenestrated and leak fluid, producing chemosis (conjunctival swelling), as a response to allergies or other inflammatory events. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion of the blood supply of the eye and ocular adnexa.</p>
				</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Sclera</p>
				<div  id="Chapt1_Top5">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera is the opaque, white, fibrous tissue that extends from the corneal limbus to the optic nerve, where it merges with the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The sclera is divided into 3 layers (from outermost inward): episclera, stroma, and lamina fusca. The sclera is 0.3–1.0&#160;mm thick and is thinnest &#173;behind the rectus muscle insertions. For additional discussion of the sclera, see BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>.</p>
					<p class="h2">Limbus</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The limbus is the transition zone between the transparent cornea and the opaque sclera. This area harbors corneal epithelial stem cells, which are responsible for the normal homeostasis and wound repair of the corneal epithelium. The <span class="italic">palisades of Vogt</span> are thought to be the site of the limbal stem cells’ niche and can be observed biomicroscopically as radially oriented fibrovascular ridges concentrated along the limbus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-4">Fig&#160;1-4</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Stem cells have an unlimited capacity for self-&#173;renewal and are slow cycling (ie, they have low mitotic activity). Once stem cell differentiation begins, it is irreversible. Renewal occurs via basal cells, with centripetal migration of stem cells from the periphery to the central cornea. This is known as the <span class="italic">XYZ hypothesis,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span> represents proliferation and stratification of limbal basal cells; <span class="italic">Y,</span> centripetal migration of basal cells; and <span class="italic">Z,</span> desquamation of superficial cells. The health of the cornea depends on the sum of X and Y being equal to Z. Damage to epithelial stem cells impairs long-&#173;term regeneration of corneal epithelial cells. Thus, an injury to the limbus may lead to loss of its barrier effect, which may result in the invasion of the conjunctiva and neovascularization of the corneal surface.</p>

					<p class="body-text">In adults, the cornea &#173;measures approximately 11–12&#160;mm horizontally and 10–11&#160;mm vertically. It is generally 500–600&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m thick at its center, gradually increasing in thickness &#173;toward the periphery.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">For nutrition, the cornea depends on diffusion of glucose from the aqueous humor and diffusion of oxygen through the tear film. The peripheral cornea is supplied with oxygen from the limbal circulation.</span> The density of nerve endings in the cornea is among the highest in the body, and the sensitivity of the cornea is 100 times that of the conjunctiva. Sensory nerve fibers extend from the long ciliary nerves, penetrating the cornea in the deep peripheral stroma near the limbus and coursing anteriorly to form a subepithelial plexus.</p>
					<p class="h2">Topographic Zones of the Cornea</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea is aspheric, although the central portion of the anterior corneal surface has been described as a spherocylindrical convex mirror. The central cornea is typically 3.00 diopters steeper than the periphery, a positive shape &#173;factor <span class="italic">(prolate).</span></p>
					<p class="body-text">Clinically, the cornea can be divided into 5 topographic zones (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-6">Fig&#160;1-6</span>):</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">central zone:</span> 3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter over the central cornea; closely resembles a &#173;spherical surface</li>

						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">peripheral,</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">transitional, zone:</span> adjacent to the paracentral zone, has an outer diam&#173;eter of approximately 11&#160;mm; is the area of greatest flattening and asphericity in the normal cornea</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">limbal zone</span> (limbus): where the cornea steepens prior to joining the sclera at the limbal sulcus; outer dia&#173;meter averages 12&#160;mm</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Other corneal reference points include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">optical zone:</span> the portion of the cornea that overlies the entrance pupil. The optical zone can change location based on the pupil size.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">corneal apex:</span> the point of maximum curvature, typically temporal to the center of the pupil</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">corneal vertex:</span> the point located at the intersection of the line of sight and the corneal surface; represented by the corneal light reflex when illuminated coaxially with fixation. It is the center of the keratoscopic image and does not necessarily correspond to the point of maximum curvature (corneal apex) or the center of the optical zone (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-7">Fig&#160;1-7</span>).</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h2">Corneal Epithelium</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hydrophobic corneal epithelium is composed of 4–6 layers, which include 1–2 layers of superficial squamous cells, 2–3 layers of broad wing cells, and an innermost layer of columnar basal cells. The epithelium is 40–50&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m thick (see Fig&#160;1-5; also see the section&#160;Pachymetry in Chapter&#160;2). The epithelium and tear film form an optically smooth surface. Tight junctions allow the superficial epithelial cells to act as a barrier, preventing penetration of tear fluid into the stroma. Continuous proliferation of limbal stem cells gives rise to the other layers of cells, which subsequently differentiate into superficial cells. With maturation of the differentiated cells, microvilli form on the outermost surface (glycocalyx), and &#173;these cells then desquamate into the tears. The &#173;process of differentiation takes approximately 7–14 days. Basal epithelial cells secrete a continuous, 50-&#173;nm-&#173;thick basement membrane, which is composed of type IV collagen, laminin, and other proteins. Corneal clarity depends on the tight packing of epithelial cells, which results in a layer with a nearly uniform refractive index and minimal light scattering.</p>
					<p class="h2">Bowman Layer</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Beneath the corneal epithelium lies the Bowman layer. Previously considered a membrane, Bowman layer is rather the acellular condensate of irregularly arranged collagen fibrils at the most anterior portion of the stroma (see Fig&#160;1-5). This layer is 8–15&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m thick and helps maintain the shape of the cornea. If disrupted, it &#173;will not regenerate.</p>
					<p class="h2">Corneal Stroma</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal stroma accounts for roughly 90% of the total corneal thickness (see Fig&#160;1-5). This layer, which is 470–500 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick, is composed of stromal cells (keratocytes), collagen fibers, and an extracellular matrix. The anterior stroma is denser than the posterior stroma &#173;because of an increased number of keratocytes and greater interweaving of collagen lamellae. <span class="keypoint_underline">The anterior 40% of the corneal stroma has twice the tensile strength of the posterior 60%.</span> This difference between the anterior and posterior stroma may play a role in the occurrence of corneal ectasia following certain cornea-&#173;based refractive surgeries.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Keratocytes vary in size and density throughout the stroma and form a 3-&#173;dimensional network throughout the cornea. &#173;These cells, which are flattened fibroblasts, are located between the stromal collagen lamellae (<span class="xref-figure"  id="Fig 1-8">Fig&#160;1-8)</span> and continually digest and manufacture stromal molecules. Keratocyte density declines with age and also following &#173;laser refractive surgery.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The extracellular matrix of the corneal stroma is formed from collagens and proteoglycans. Type I and type V fibrillar collagens are intertwined with filaments of type VI collagen. The major corneal proteoglycans are decorin (associated with dermatan sulfate) and lumican (associated with keratan sulfate).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The &#173;organized distribution of keratocytes, collagen fibers, and the extracellular matrix in the corneal stroma is necessary for a clear cornea. Corneal transparency also depends on maintaining the &#173;water content of the corneal stroma at 78%. Corneal hydration is largely controlled by intact epithelial and endothelial barriers and the functioning of the endothelial pump, which is linked to an ion-&#173;transport system controlled by temperature-&#173;dependent enzymes such as Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-4">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-4">+</span>-&#173;ATPase. In addition, negatively charged stromal glycosaminoglycans tend to repel each other, producing a <span class="italic">swelling pressure (SP).</span> &#173;Because intraocular pressure (IOP) tends to compress the cornea, the overall imbibition pressure of the corneal stroma is calculated as IOP <span class="symbol">−</span> SP. Corneal hydration varies from anterior to posterior and increases closer to the endothelium.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The most posterior aspect of the stroma forms a thin (approximately 15-&#173;<span class="greek">µ</span>m-&#173;thick) acellular layer that is tightly adherent to the Descemet membrane.

					<p class="h2">Descemet Membrane</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Descemet membrane is the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium (see Fig&#160;1-5). It is composed of an anterior banded zone that develops in utero and a posterior amorphous, nonbanded zone that is laid down throughout life. The thickness of Descemet membrane increases with age, from 3&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m at birth to 10–12&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m by adulthood.

					<p class="h2">Corneal Endothelium</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal endothelium is a 4–6-&#173;<span class="greek">µ</span>m-&#173;thick single layer of closely interdigitated, mostly hexagonal cells arranged in a mosaic pattern. &#173;These cells lie on the posterior surface of the cornea (see Fig&#160;1-5). If cell loss occurs, especially as a result of trauma or surgery, the defective area is initially covered through a &#173;process of cell enlargement and spread of surrounding cells or perhaps peripheral stem cells. &#173;These cellular findings can be observed by specular or confocal microscopy as polymegethism (variability in cell size) and polymorphism (variability in cell shape). It was previously thought that corneal endothelial cells &#173;were unable to replicate. <span class="keypoint_underline">&#173;Whether &#173;these cells have some mitotic potential, particularly the cells in the corneal periphery, is &#173;under investigation. Migration of &#173;these cells may be augmented by pharmacologic agents such as Rho kinase inhibitors.</span></p>

					<p class="body-text">Cell density varies throughout the endothelial layer; the concentration is typically highest in the periphery. Central endothelial cell density decreases with age at an average rate of approximately 0.6% per year, diminishing from a value of about 3400&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> at age 15&#160;years to about 2300&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> at age 85&#160;years. The normal central endothelial cell count is between 2000 and 3000&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>. It has been observed that eyes with an endothelial cell count below 500&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> may be at risk for development of corneal edema.</p>
					<p class="body-text">As mentioned &#173;earlier, the corneal endothelium helps maintain corneal transparency by controlling corneal hydration and maintaining stromal deturgescence. It does so through its functions as a barrier to the aqueous humor and as a metabolic pump that moves ions, and draws &#173;water osmotically, from the stroma into the aqueous humor. The barrier and pump functions of the endothelium can be &#173;measured clinically by fluorophotometry and pachymetry. The endothelium must also be permeable to nutrients and other molecules from the aqueous humor. Increased permeability and insufficient pump sites occur with reduced endothelial cell density, although the cell density at which clinically evident edema occurs is not an absolute.</p>

				<div  id="Chapt1_Top7">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The external eye and cornea comprise complexly integrated tissues that, along with the tear film, help protect the eye against infection and other ocular conditions. For an in-&#173;depth discussion of the immune system and ocular immune responses, see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span> BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> discusses the biochemistry and metabolism of the tear film and cornea. The following discussion focuses on the major immunologic features of the conjunctiva and cornea.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The normal, uninflamed conjunctiva contains neutrophils, lymphocytes (including regulatory T cells, which dampen the immune response), macrophages, plasma cells, and mast cells. The conjunctival stroma contains dendritic antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs). The conjunctival epithelium has a special subpopulation of dendritic APCs known as <span class="italic">Langerhans cells,</span> which are capable of both uptake of antigens and sensitizing of antigen-&#173;inexperienced (naive) T lymphocytes (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 1-9">Fig 1-9</span>). Hence, &#173;these dendritic cells serve as the sentinel cells of the immune system of the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In addition to containing immune cells, the conjunctiva is supplied with blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which facilitate the migration of immune cells and antigens to the draining lymph nodes, where the adaptive immune response is generated. This occurs through the recruitment of regulatory T cells, which return to the ocular surface to modulate and suppress the local immune response.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Like the conjunctiva, the normal, uninflamed cornea is sparsely endowed with dendritic cells. &#173;These dendritic APCs in the corneal epithelium are also Langerhans cells (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-9</span>). See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span> for discussion of immune-&#173;related disorders and corneal graft rejection.</p>
