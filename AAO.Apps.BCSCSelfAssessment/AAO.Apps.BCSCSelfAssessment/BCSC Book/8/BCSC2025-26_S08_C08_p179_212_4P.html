				<div id="Chapt8_Top1">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with corneal dystrophies can be asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may include blurred vision due to irregular astigmatism or corneal clouding due to deposition of material or edema. In addition, patients may experience foreign-&#173;body sensation and photophobia due to corneal erosions. Depending on the symptoms and diagnosis, treatment can range from conservative &#173;measures (eg, contact lens or topical supportive or therapeutic drops) to surgical options (including surface ablation and all types of corneal transplantation).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Corneal dystrophies typically</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">are inherited conditions that appear to have &#173;little or no relationship to environmental or systemic disease</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">arise from ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variants (mutations) that result in deposition of aberrant proteins (eg, alterations in the transforming growth &#173;factor beta–&#173;induced gene <span class="bullet-list_italic">[TGFBI],</span> which leads to production of keratoepithelin) </li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">are classified by their anatomical location (epithelial, stromal, endothelial)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">are first detectable early in life (late-&#173;onset Fuchs dystrophy is an exception)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">pro&#173;gress slowly, increase with age, and are often not symptomatic &#173;until &#173;later in life</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">are bilateral, with symmetric involvement (asymmetry does occur)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">can be associated with recurrent erosion as a result of disruption of the epithelial basement membrane or Bowman layer</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">The International Committee for the Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) revised the dystrophy nomenclature for a third time in 2024 to more accurately reflect the evolving ge&#173;ne&#173;tic, clinical, and histologic characteristics of the conditions, which are classified into 4 groups:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">epithelial and subepithelial dystrophies</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">epithelial–&#173;stromal <span class="bullet-list_italic">TGFBI</span> dystrophies</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">stromal dystrophies</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">endothelial dystrophies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">In addition to the 4 classification groups, each dystrophy is assigned to 1 of 4 categories on the basis of established mapped and identified ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variants. Category&#160;1 denotes a well-&#173;defined dystrophy in which the gene has been mapped and identified and the specific variants are known, whereas Category&#160;4 is reserved for suspected, new, or previously documented dystrophies that lack convincing and reproducible ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mapping. Although ge&#173;ne&#173;tics has an increasingly impor&#173;tant role in the classification of corneal dystrophies and in &#173;future potential therapies, laboratory testing is not readily available or financially feasible for routine diagnosis. Therefore, a core clinical knowledge of corneal dystrophies is most practical for the reader of this edition.</p>
					<p class="body-text">This chapter primarily discusses Category&#160;1 dystrophies. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (Category&#160;3) and pre-&#173;Descemet corneal dystrophy (Category&#160;4) are also included &#173;here. Although &#173;these latter conditions most likely represent corneal degenerations (ie, given their lack of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mapping), they have been firmly established in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture (including in the IC3D review) as corneal dystrophies and are thus discussed in this chapter.

					<p class="h2-h1">Epithelial and Subepithelial Dystrophies</p>

					<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h4-head">Alternative names</span> Map-&#173;dot-&#173;fingerprint dystrophy, anterior basement membrane dystrophy, Cogan microcystic epithelial dystrophy</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inheritance</span> No inheritance documented. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD) is considered degenerative and not a true dystrophy; however, it is listed among the dystrophies &#173;because of its historical classification.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> EBMD occurs in 6%–18% of the US population, more commonly in &#173;women, with increasing frequency in patients older than 50&#160;years. The typical findings in the corneal epithelium are best seen by using a broad oblique slit-&#173;lamp beam or with retroillumination. (See <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span> for a discussion of slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscopy.) The clinician can also identify EBMD by using the sclerotic scatter illumination technique. Using &#173;these techniques, the clinician can observe 4 typical patterns:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">fingerprint lines</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">maps</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">dots</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">bleb pattern</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">&#173;These abnormalities occur in varying combinations and can change in number and distribution over time. <span class="italic">Fingerprint lines</span> are thin, parallel, hairlike lines that may be arranged in a concentric pattern resembling fingerprints or a &#173;horse’s tail (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-1">Fig&#160;8-1</span>). <span class="italic">Maps</span> are geographic, irregular patterns or islands of thickened, gray, hazy epithelium with scalloped, circumscribed borders resembling coastlines (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-2">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). <span class="italic">Dots</span> are irregular round, oval, or comma-&#173;shaped intraepithelial opacities with discrete edges that contain the debris of epithelial cells; &#173;these cells collapsed and degenerated before reaching the epithelial surface (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-3">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). The <span class="italic">bleb pattern</span> resembles pebbled glass and is best seen with retroillumination.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Symptoms such as foreign-&#173;body sensation are typically related to recurrent epithelial erosions. Blurred vision and monocular diplopia, commonly described by patients as seeing “ghost” or “shadow” images, occur most frequently in patients older than 30&#160;years. The impact of EBMD on vision correlates with the degree of surface disruption in proximity to the visual axis. The surface disruption appears as an irregularity with instillation of topical fluorescein. Elevated areas of irregular epithelium may appear dark with a cobalt blue filter, with fluorescein pooling at the base. Irregular astigmatism is confirmed on keratometry as irregular mires or on Placido disk imaging as irregular rings (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-4">Fig&#160;8-4</span>).</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Refracting over a rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lens neutralizes superficial corneal surface irregularities and helps determine the impact of these findings on visual potential. That is, the patient may experience improved vision with the RGP lens in place, as it smooths the irregular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Symptoms of recurrent erosion typically occur in the morning; however, discomfort in the morning may also occur in patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos. In the latter, however, punctate erosions are usually noted in the inferior cornea. It is estimated that 10% of patients with EBMD have corneal erosions, but up to 50% of &#173;those with recurrent corneal erosions also have EBMD. Therefore, examination of the fellow eye is recommended.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Unilateral dystrophic changes may be attributed to an asymmetric dystrophy or focal trauma. In some cases, clinical findings may mimic &#173;those of corneal malignancy; therefore, submitting removed material for histologic study may be warranted.</p>

Elsevier; 2022:696–801. <span class="reference_italic">Cornea;</span> vol 1.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> EBMD is an abnormality of epithelial turnover, maturation, and production of basement membrane. Histologic findings include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">intraepithelial extension of basal laminar material (fingerprint lines)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">sheets of intraepithelial, multilamellar basal laminar material (maps)</li>

					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Asymptomatic patients usually do not require treatment. In patients with irregular astigmatism and blurred vision, epithelial debridement may be helpful. Most recurrent corneal erosions resulting from EBMD can be managed medically with hypertonic sodium chloride ointment at night and/or drops during the day. Alternative therapies may include increasing lubrication (ie, punctal plugs, topical cyclosporine, or artificial tears) or a temporary &#173;bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane application. The use of a protective shield during sleep can also be helpful. Surgical management of recurrent erosions includes epithelial debridement, anterior stromal puncture, excimer &#173;laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), or superficial keratectomy with diamond burr polishing. See <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for further discussion of recurrent corneal erosion.</p>
					<p class="h3">Meesmann corneal dystrophy</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Alternative names</span> Juvenile hereditary epithelial dystrophy</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inheritance</span> Autosomal dominant (AD)</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD) appears very early in life. Tiny intraepithelial vesicles that extend to the limbus are seen most easily at the slit lamp with indirect illumination or retroillumination. The vesicles appear as minute bubblelike blebs (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-5">Fig&#160;8-5</span>). In 85% of eyes with MECD, the entire epithelium is affected; however, the epithelium surrounding the cyst is clear. Whorled and wedge-&#173;shaped epithelial patterns may be observed. The cornea may be slightly thinned, and corneal sensation may be reduced. Symptoms are usually &#173;limited to mild ocular irritation and a slight decrease in vision. Some patients report glare and light sensitivity. Painful recurrent erosions may also occur.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> Intraepithelial cysts consisting of degenerated epithelial cell products, which stain with periodic acid–&#173;Schiff (PAS) reagent, are pre&#173;sent. The epithelial cells contain an electron-&#173;dense accumulation of fibrogranular material surrounded by tangles of cytoplasmic filaments (ie, “peculiar substance”). &#173;There are frequent mitoses and a thickened basement membrane with projections into the basal epithelium. On confocal microscopy, hyporeflective areas ranging in dia&#173;meter from 40&#160;µm to 150&#160;µm are generally observed in the basal epithelium; however, some scattered hyperreflective circular spots may also be observed within &#173;these areas.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Most patients require no treatment, but if symptoms are frequent, soft contact lens wear may be helpful.</p>
					<p class="h3">Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Alternative names</span> Band-&#173;shaped and whorled microcystic dystrophy of the corneal epithelium</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inheritance</span> AD</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Patients with Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy (LECD) may be asymptomatic or may report blurred vision (if the central visual axis is involved). With direct and indirect illumination on slit-&#173;lamp examination, gray epithelial opacities are visualized in patterns (whorl-&#173;like, bands, flame or feather &#173;shaped) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-6">Fig&#160;8-6</span>). &#173;These lesions pro&#173;gress slowly and can recur &#173;after excision.</p>
					<p class="body-text">LECD may be confused with whorl keratopathy, limbal stem cell deficiency, and corneal malignancy. Clinical correlation is needed to identify a precipitating event for limbal stem cell deficiency. The presence of vascularity can help discern corneal malignancy from LECD.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> On histologic examination, vacuoles stain with PAS. Confocal microscopy demonstrates 4 characteristic features: highly hyperreflective cytoplasm with hyporeflective nuclei, uniform involvement of all epithelial layers, distinct borders with adjacent normal epithelium, and limbal involvement.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Same as for EBMD management. Surgical intervention is rarely needed.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Onset of gelatinous droplike corneal dystrophy (GDLD) is in the first to second &#173;decade of life. Groups of multiple small nodules (mulberry configuration; <span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-7">Fig&#160;8-7A</span>) or lesions that appear similar to &#173;those of band keratopathy (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-7B</span>) can be observed just beneath the epithelial layer. The lesions are vis&#173;i&#173;ble on fluorescein staining. Superficial vascularization is often pre&#173;sent. Stromal opacification (Fig&#160;8-7C) or larger nodular lesions (kumquat-&#173;like lesions; Fig&#160;8-7D) may develop as the condition progresses. Individuals with GDLD typically experience a significant decrease in vision, with photophobia, irritation, and tearing.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> Light microscopy reveals subepithelial and stromal amyloid deposits. Disruption of tight junctions leads to abnormally high epithelial permeability. Confocal microscopy shows irregular, elongated epithelial cells with large accumulations of brightly reflective material (amyloid) noted within or beneath the epithelium and within the anterior stroma. Amyloid deposition may be noted in the basal epithelial layer on transmission electron microscopy. See also <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span> for discussion of amyloidosis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Surgical treatment options include superficial keratectomy, lamellar keratoplasty (LK), or penetrating keratoplasty (PK). However, &#173;there is a high recurrence rate within a few years of treatment. Soft contact lens use may help reduce postoperative recurrences.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The dystrophies in this class are caused by pathogenic variants in the same gene, <span class="italic">TGFBI,</span> and have been mapped to 5q31. However, each dystrophy has a specific point mutation that genet&#173;ically differentiates it from the &#173;others (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 8-2">&#173;Table&#160;8-2</span>).</p>

Confluent, irregular, and coarse geographic opacities with varying densities develop primarily in the central cornea at both the level of Bowman layer and the superficial stroma (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-8">Fig&#160;8-8A</span>). Over time, the opacities may extend to the limbus and deeper stroma.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The posterior cornea appears normal. In moderate to advanced cases, stromal scarring can lead to surface irregularity. Symptoms often begin in the first or second &#173;decade of life with painful recurrent epithelial erosions. The erosions in eyes with RBCD are usually more severe and more frequent than in eyes with Thiel-&#173;Behnke corneal dystrophy (TBCD), but they recur less often over time. Anterior scarring and associated surface irregularity both contribute to reduced vision.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> Confocal microscopy (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8B</span>) shows distinct deposits in the epithelium and Bowman layer (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8C</span>). The basal epithelial cell layer and Bowman layer show greater reflectivity in RBCD than in TBCD. RBCD reflectivity stems from small granular or amorphous material without shadows. In TBCD, the deposits in the basal epithelial cell layer, which show less reflectivity, are accompanied by dark shadows. In RBCD, light microscopy (see <span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8C</span>) reveals disruption or absence of Bowman layer and replacement with a sheetlike connective tissue layer. This layer contains granular deposits that stain red with Masson trichrome stain. Transmission electron microscopy shows subepithelial electron-&#173;dense rod-&#173;shaped bodies that are immunopositive for the TGFBI protein, also called <span class="h5-text_italic">keratoepithelin.</span> Electron microscopy is helpful in differentiating RBCD histologically from TBCD, which has curly fibers (see the Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy section).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Initial treatment of RBCD is aimed at the recurrent erosions. Superficial keratectomy, PTK, LK, or, in rare instances, PK may be performed. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has a lower risk of endothelial rejection and reduced risk of corneal rupture associated with trauma compared with PK. Recurrence in a graft is common in all forms of keratoplasty.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The onset of Thiel-&#173;Behnke corneal dystrophy (TBCD) is in the first or second &#173;decade of life, manifesting as solitary flecks at the level of Bowman layer. Over time, symmetric subepithelial reticular opacities develop in a honeycomb pattern, sparing the peripheral cornea (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-9">Fig&#160;8-9A</span>). The opacities may pro&#173;gress to the deep stromal layers and the corneal periphery. Distinguishing TBCD from RBCD clinically is difficult, but noninvasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy may help differentiate &#173;these entities. Recurrent erosions are less frequent and less severe in TBCD than in RBCD. Vision decreases secondary to increased corneal opacification.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> Anterior segment OCT (AS-&#173;OCT) demonstrates hyperreflective material at the level of Bowman layer in a characteristic sawtooth configuration that helps distinguish TBCD from RBCD (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-9B</span>). Light microscopy (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-9C</span>) shows irregular thickening and thinning of the epithelial layer, which offset the ridges and furrows in the under&#173;lying stroma and the focal absences of the epithelial basement membrane. Bowman layer is replaced with fibrocellular material in the same pathognomonic wavy or sawtooth pattern. On electron microscopy, curly fibers (9–15&#160;nm) rather than rod-&#173;shaped bodies are apparent, further distinguishing this dystrophy from RBCD. &#173;These curly fibers are immunopositive for the TGFBI protein, which is associated with the 5q31 locus. On confocal microscopy, distinct deposits are observed in the epithelium and Bowman layer. The deposits in the basal epithelial cell layer show moderate reflectivity, with round edges and dark shadows not seen in RBCD.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Classic lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD), formerly called <span class="h5-text_italic">LCD type 1,</span> is relatively common and is characterized by refractile branching lines, so-&#173;called lattice lines, in the corneal stroma. The spectrum of corneal changes is broad, and the classic branching lattice lines may not be pre&#173;sent in all cases. Subtle refractile lines, central and subepithelial ovoid white dots, and diffuse anterior stromal haze appear early in life and, in a corneal graft, &#173;these may be the first signs of recurrence. The typical refractile branching lines develop as the condition progresses and are best observed against a red reflex or with indirect illumination (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-10">Fig&#160;8-10</span>). &#173;These lines start centrally and superficially and spread centrifugally, becoming deeper. The stroma can take on a “ground-&#173;glass” appearance, but the peripheral cornea typically remains relatively clear. Epithelial erosions may occur as early as the first &#173;decade of life and recur often. Stromal haze and epithelial surface irregularity may decrease vision, typically in the fourth &#173;decade.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Familial amyloidosis with lattice corneal changes (formerly LCD type II) is no longer considered a dystrophy (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>). Variant LCD type IIIA is associated with severe erosions that occur &#173;later in life. Thick, ropy lattice lines and heavy amyloid deposits are pre&#173;sent (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-11">Fig&#160;8-11</span>). &#173;Because the findings in LCD type IV occur more posteriorly than &#173;those in type IIIA, type IV is less likely to be associated with erosions.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-3"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Crystalline deposits related to monoclonal gammopathy may resemble lattice lines. Polymorphic amyloid degeneration (PAD) is often confused with lattice dystrophy; however, PAD pre&#173;sents in older individuals and occurs in the central and paracentral cornea, predominantly affecting the midstroma and posterior stroma. (See <span class="sidebar-text--no-indent-_clinic1_xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>, &#173;Table&#160;10-3 for a summary of the ways in which amyloid occurs in the eye.)</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> Light microscopy of classic LCD reveals arborizing amyloid deposits concentrated most heavi&#173;ly in the anterior stroma. Amyloid may also accumulate in the subepithelial area, giving rise to poor epithelial–&#173;stromal adhesion, which results in corneal erosions. Epithelial atrophy and disruption, with degeneration of basal epithelial cells and focal thinning or absence of Bowman layer, progressively increase with age. An eosinophilic layer develops between the epithelial basement membrane and Bowman layer, with stromal deposition of the amyloid substance distorting the corneal lamellar architecture.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The onset of granular corneal dystrophy type 1 (GCD1) occurs early in life with crumblike opacities in the superficial cornea. With direct illumination, the opacities appear white; however, indirect illumination reveals small translucent dots with vacuoles and a glassy splinter or “crushed bread crumb” appearance. Early in the disease &#173;process, the lesions are separated by clear spaces but &#173;later become more confluent. The lesions do not extend to the limbus but can extend anteriorly through focal breaks in Bowman layer (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 8-14">Fig&#160;8-14</span>). GCD1 is slowly progressive, with most patients maintaining good vision and visual acuity, dropping to 20/200 only &#173;after age 50&#160;years in rare cases. Patients report glare and photophobia. Recurrent erosions occur, and vision decreases as the opacities become more confluent.</p>

Electron microscopy reveals an electron-&#173;dense material made up of rod-&#173;shaped bodies immersed in an amorphous matrix.

The dashlike lines are deep to &#173;these opacities. In addition, the lines in GCD2 rarely cross each other. In contrast, the lines in classic LCD frequently intersect and are more refractile. Youn&#173;ger patients with GCD2 have commonly recognized “clear intervening spaces” between the deposits.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Fuchs dystrophy usually pre&#173;sents in the fourth &#173;decade of life or &#173;later, although early-&#173;onset FECD may pre&#173;sent in the first &#173;decade of life. Symptoms are rare before age 50&#160;years. As cornea guttae become confluent and endothelial fibrosis occurs, patients report glare and reduced contrast sensitivity. Symptoms often stem from corneal edema, which &#173;causes a decrease in vision. A distinguishing symptom of FECD is fogging of vision upon awakening due to decreased surface evaporation during sleep, which &#173;causes corneal edema. As endothelial function declines, corneal edema produces microbullae or microcystic edema. This can cause foreign-&#173;body sensation, also a symptom of dry eye, with which FECD may be confused. As FECD progresses, corneal edema and clouding change pachymetry results and lead to reduced vision. Painful episodes may subside once subepithelial fibrosis occurs.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Findings vary with the stage of FECD. Cornea guttae are first evident centrally and then spread &#173;toward the periphery (stage 1). In some patients, cornea guttae develop, but the disease never progresses beyond this stage (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-24">Fig&#160;8-24</span>). Cornea guttae may become confluent and take on a “beaten metal” appearance (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 8-25">Fig&#160;8-25</span>). In late-&#173;onset FECD, cornea guttae are larger than &#173;those observed in early-&#173;onset FECD. Stage 2 is characterized by endothelial decompensation and stromal edema. As the disease progresses, stromal edema may worsen, causing bullous keratopathy (stage 3). Descemet membrane may become thickened. Central corneal thickness may approach 1&#160;mm (0.5–0.6&#160;mm is typically considered normal). This can be associated with increased light scatter and symptoms of glare. In end-&#173;stage disease (stage 4), subepithelial fibrosis, scarring, and peripheral superficial vascularization secondary to chronic edema occur.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Although specular microscopy may be helpful in the initial evaluation of Fuchs dystrophy and in following the clinical course for loss of corneal endothelial cells, it is not necessary in the presence of diffuse confluent cornea guttae. Corneal thickness &#173;measurement with Scheimpflug tomography, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound biomicroscopy, or ultrasonic pachymetry provides a better indicator of corneal endothelial function. A significant increase in corneal thickness in the morning or over time or an increase in posterior elevation over time may indicate endothelial dysfunction. See <span class="sidebar-text--no-indent-_clinic1_xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span> for more detailed discussion of corneal pachymetry and specular microscopy.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology</span> In FECD, the endothelial cells are more varied in size (polymegethism) and shape (pleomorphism) than normal and are disrupted by excrescences of collagen. See the section&#160;Evaluation of Endothelial Appearance and Function in Chapter&#160;2 for further discussion. Primary dysfunction of the endothelial cells manifests as increased corneal edema and deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix in a thickened Descemet membrane. It is not clear &#173;whether the reduction in the posterior nonbanded zone and the increase in thickness of the abnormal posterior collagenous layer are primary effects of endothelial dysfunction or are secondary to chronic corneal edema.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Early morning blurred vision or minor pain related to corneal edema can be reduced with hypertonic sodium chloride drops and ointment (5%) and/or &#173;measures taken to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). Note that topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may decrease endothelial pump function and increase corneal edema.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Restoration of vision generally requires keratoplasty. In the absence of significant scarring, PK has largely been replaced with endothelial keratoplasty (EK; &#173;either Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty [DSAEK] or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty [DMEK]). If significant stromal scarring is pre&#173;sent, full-&#173;thickness keratoplasty should be considered. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> for discussion of keratoplasty.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In cases where the guttae are confined to the central cornea, Descemet stripping only, with the addition of a topical Rho kinase inhibitor to stimulate endothelial proliferation, is an alternative to keratoplasty that eliminates the risk of rejection; however, it may have a prolonged postoperative course. Recent advances using an injection of in vitro<span class="figuredash">‒</span>cultured endothelial cells have shown promise in helping with endothelial cell loss. This approach is &#173;under clinical investigation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If keratoplasty cannot be done, per&#173;sis&#173;tent or more severe pain can be managed with anterior stromal puncture, &#173;bandage contact lenses designed for extended wear, placement of amniotic tissue, or conjunctival flap surgery (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>).</p>

					<p class="body-text">A diffuse abnormality of Descemet membrane is common in PPCD, including thickening of the posterior nonbanded layer, a multilaminated appearance, and polymorphous alterations. Similar changes that are not &#173;limited to the cornea are seen in iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>). However, ICE is sporadic and almost always unilateral. In patients with PPCD, specular microscopy may reveal typical vesicles and bands. In contrast, in ICE syndrome, involved endothelial cells show a characteristic reversal of the normal “light–&#173;dark” pattern seen with specular microscopy, appearing as dark areas with central highlights and light peripheral borders (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>, Fig&#160;6-21&#160;in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>).

In cases of localized swelling, anterior stromal puncture can be used to induce focal subepithelial fibrosis.

If peripheral anterior synechiae, glaucoma, or both are pre&#173;sent preoperatively, the prognosis for successful corneal transplant is reduced. PPCD may recur in the graft.
