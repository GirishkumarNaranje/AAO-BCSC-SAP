				<div id="Chapt15_Top1">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chemical injuries to the external eye can range in severity from mild irritation to complete destruction of the ocular surface and adnexa (eyelids), resulting in corneal opacification, loss of vision, and even loss of the eye. Some of the most severe ocular chemical injuries are caused by strong alkalis or acids used in assault. <span class="xref-table" id="Table 15-1">&#173;Table&#160;15-1</span> lists some common caustic chemicals that can cause ocular injury.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the offending chemical agent should be identified. The severity of a chemical injury depends on the pH (acid or alkali), volume, concentration, duration of contact, and inherent toxicity of the chemical. Frequently, the container of the toxic agent offers instructions for treatment or a phone number to call for detailed assistance (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;15-1</span>).</p>

					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Alkali Burns</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most severe chemical injuries to the external eye occur &#173;after contact with alkaline (high-&#173;pH) solutions &#173;because they cause saponification of fatty acids in cell membranes and ultimately cellular disruption. Once the surface epithelium has been damaged, alkaline solutions readily penetrate the corneal stroma, where they rapidly destroy the proteoglycan ground substance and collagen fibers of the stromal matrix. Strong alkaline substances may also penetrate through the endothelium into the anterior chamber, causing severe tissue damage and intense inflammation. The prognosis for vision is often determined by the extent of ocular surface injury and the effect of skin burns on eyelid function.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Classification and grading schemes</span> for chemical injuries help characterize the severity of the injury and determine the prognosis. The Hughes classification scheme (modified by Thoft) divides chemical injuries of the cornea according to clinical findings. The new scheme by Dua, shown in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 15-2">&#173;Table&#160;15-2,</span> establishes the grade of injury based on findings and expected outcomes.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">The poorest visual prognosis occurs in patients with extensive limbal epithelial stem cell damage.</span> The limbus contains corneal epithelial stem cells (see Chapters&#160;1 and 4); damage to this region can impair corneal reepithelialization. Blanching occurs when the vascular supply to this critical area is disrupted by death of vascular endothelial cells in the conjunctiva. The resultant limbal and anterior segment ischemia is a poor prognostic feature (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-1">Figs&#160;15-1 through 15-4</span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-2"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-3"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-4"></span>
					). If the conjunctiva recovers, neovascularization may occur (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-5">Fig&#160;15-5</span>). Severe trauma also leads to repopulation of the corneal surface epithelium with undifferentiated conjunctival cells, which leads to reduced epithelial adhesion, recurrent breakdown, and chronic inflammation. Intraocular chemical penetration may result in cataract formation and secondary glaucoma; the latter is thought to result from damage to the trabecular meshwork, which can affect outflow fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty.</p>

					<p class="h2">Acid Burns</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acid solutions with low pH tend to cause less-&#173;severe tissue damage than alkaline solutions &#173;because acids denature and precipitate proteins in the tissues they contact, forming a barrier to penetration. Mild acid burns can cause an epithelial defect (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-6">Fig&#160;15-6</span>), and acid burns can severely damage the ocular surface. However, in contrast to alkali burns, &#173;there is a lower chance of corneal melting or penetration of the solution into the anterior chamber. The exception is hydrofluoric acid burns, which can cause significant anterior segment destruction.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Acid burns do not directly cause loss of the proteoglycan ground substance in the cornea, but they can incite severe inflammation and damage to the corneal matrix and result in corneal opacification (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-7">Fig&#160;15-7</span>) or symblepharon formation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-8">Fig&#160;15-8</span>).</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="keypoint_underline">The most impor&#173;tant step in the management of chemical injuries is immediate, copious irrigation of the ocular surface with &#173;water or balanced saline solution.</span> If &#173;these liquids are not available, the clinician may use any other pure, nontoxic solution to rinse the ocular surface and dilute the offending agent. Buffer solutions may also be considered &#173;after initial irrigation.</p>
					<p class="h3">Irrigation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before irrigation, the patient should receive a topical anesthetic, and the patient’s eyelid can be retracted and held with a retractor or eyelid speculum. Irrigation may be accomplished using handheld intravenous tubing; an irrigating eyelid speculum; or a Morgan lens, a special scleral contact lens that connects to intravenous tubing. Irrigation should continue &#173;until the pH of the conjunctival sac normalizes (pH 7.0–7.3). The pH should be rechecked 10 minutes &#173;after irrigation to ensure that the acid or base has been neutralized and that no chemical liquid or particles remain. When a pH strip is unavailable, it is better to overtreat with prolonged periods of irrigation than to assume that the pH has normalized and discontinue treatment too early.</p>
					<p class="h3">Removal of particulates</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Particulate chemicals are removed from the ocular surface with cotton-&#173;tipped applicators and/or forceps, as prolonged exposure to toxic particles can exacerbate chemical damage to the ocular surface. The upper eyelid is everted in order to search for material in the upper fornix (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-9">Fig&#160;15-9</span>), and the fornices are swept with an applicator to ensure that no particulate &#173;matter remains in the eye. Debridement of the necrotic corneal epithelium minimizes the release of inflammatory mediators from damaged epithelial cells and promotes reepithelialization.</p>
					<p class="h3">Medi&#173;cations</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Use of topical cycloplegics is recommended and may be continued for patients experiencing discomfort or significant anterior chamber reaction. In the early stage of a chemical injury, intraocular pressure (IOP) may increase; IOP can be controlled by use of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which avoid the toxicity of topical glaucoma medi&#173;cations. However, if the corneal epithelium is healing normally, topical therapies may be used as well. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for a detailed discussion of medi&#173;cations used to control IOP.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In the intermediate period (ie, over the next week or more), management is focused on decreasing inflammation, preventing infection, monitoring IOP, limiting matrix degradation, and promoting reepithelialization of the cornea. An intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration of the corneal stroma can occur &#173;after acute alkali burns. PMNs deliver proteolytic enzymes that, in the absence of an intact epithelium, dissolve corneal stromal collagen and ground substance. <span class="keypoint_underline">Corticosteroids are excellent inhibitors </span><span class="keypoint_underline">of PMN function, and intensive treatment with a topical corticosteroid is recommended for up to 7–14 days &#173;after a chemical injury.</span> Thereafter, the frequency of the corticosteroid drops is markedly reduced to prevent inhibition of wound healing and exacerbation of stromal melting. Corticosteroids slow epithelial wound healing and increase the risk of secondary infection by inhibiting normal ocular surface immune defense mechanisms, so their associated risks in the chronic phase may exceed their benefits. However, in the presence of an epithelial defect, a topical antibiotic drop or ointment should be maintained.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Oral tetracyclines and topical sodium citrate 10% can chelate extracellular calcium, which can inhibit PMN degranulation. In theory, this &#173;process can help inhibit PMN-&#173;induced collagenolysis. Topical medroxyprogesterone 1% may also be effective in suppressing collagen breakdown. &#173;Measures that promote wound healing and inhibit collagenolytic activity prevent stromal ulceration.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Systemic administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to rabbits with acute corneal alkaline injuries has restored normal levels of aqueous humor ascorbate and significantly reduced the incidence of ulceration. High-&#173;dose ascorbic acid is believed to promote collagen synthesis in an alkali-&#173;burned eye, given that ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for collagen synthesis. Some studies recommend that patients take 1–2&#160;g of vitamin C per day. &#173;Because this therapy is potentially toxic to the kidneys, however, ascorbic acid generally is not administered to patients with compromised renal function.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A dry ocular surface is a hindrance to healing and any surgical treatment. In the intermediate and chronic stages of a chemical injury, frequent use of nonpreserved topical lubricants helps facilitate epithelial healing. The use of serum tears has also been beneficial in the treatment of advanced injuries.</p>

					<p class="h3">Surgical procedures</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A &#173;bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane graft may help promote ocular surface reepithelization. Amniotic membrane may be helpful not only in promoting reepithelialization but also in suppressing inflammation and preventing symblepharon formation. A temporary or permanent tarsorrhaphy facilitates reepithelialization due to increased corneal coverage. Avascular sclera usually does not epithelialize &#173;until revascularization occurs. If scleral melting occurs, a rotational graft of tarsoconjunctival tissue from the adjacent eyelid can be performed to promote revascularization.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Autologous conjunctival or limbal stem cell transplantation using tissue from the patient’s uninjured eye may facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect. When &#173;there are no signs of corneal epithelialization &#173;after chemical injury, limbal stem cell transplantation may be performed. However, the prognosis of limbal grafts is better when the eye is not inflamed; therefore, it is preferable to wait &#173;until the acute inflammation has subsided. A technique known as <span class="italic">&#173;simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET)</span> combines limbal stem cell transplantation with the use of amniotic membrane (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>). When &#173;there is damage to the conjunctiva of both eyes, then &#173;either amniotic membrane alone or oral mucosal grafts may be necessary.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In the long term, corneal transplant prognosis is improved if the ocular surface inflammation has resolved &#173;either over time (months to years) or &#173;after limbal stem cell grafting (ocular surface reconstruction). Even when &#173;there is no active ocular surface inflammation, stromal vascularization in the host bed is associated with a much higher risk of rejection following keratoplasty. Keratoprosthesis is another surgical option, but the prognosis is still best when the inflammation is &#173;under control.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Patients with severe alkali burns are fortunate if the conjunctival and corneal surfaces vascularize and stabilize. Although they may be poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty &#173;because the loss of surface goblet cells impairs graft survival, limbal stem cell transplantation with subsequent keratoplasty or keratoprosthesis may be an option. In the most severe cases, however, phthisis may occur. The absence of vascularization may also lead to stromal melting and perforation.</p>

			<p class="h1">Thermal and Radiation Injuries</p>
				<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
					<p class="h2-h1">Thermal Burns</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Heat</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Heat is a primary cause of inflammation and stromal protease expression and, when severe, can lead to collagen destruction. Rapid-&#173;reflex eyelid closure, Bell phenomenon, and reflex movement away from the source of intense heat usually limit damage to the globe from flames. Burns from molten metal that stays in contact with the eye are more likely to cause corneal injuries that result in permanent scarring.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Curling irons, cigarettes, and hot liquids splashed into the eye, especially during cooking, are common &#173;house&#173;hold &#173;causes of corneal burns (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-10">Fig&#160;15-10</span>). &#173;These burns are usually &#173;limited to the epithelium and generally require only a brief period of antibiotics, nonpreserved artificial tears, and cycloplegic therapy; patients should be followed up closely for infection and traumatic anterior uveitis. Corneal wound burns related to cataract surgery are an iatrogenic cause of thermal injury that may lead to irregular astigmatism or difficulty obtaining a watertight wound &#173;after phacoemulsification. In a patient with a history of multiple, repeated thermal burns, the possibility of child abuse should be considered.</p>
					<p class="body-text">For burns caused by heat, the primary objectives of therapy are to</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">relieve discomfort</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">prevent secondary corneal inflammation, ulceration, and perforation from infection or from exposure caused by eyelid damage</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">minimize eyelid scarring and resultant malfunction</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">A cycloplegic agent can help relieve discomfort from ciliary spasm or iridocyclitis. Use of prophylactic antibiotics (topical and/or systemic) can help prevent infection of burned eyelids and/or reduce the chances of infectious corneal ulceration. &#173;Limited debridement of devitalized tissues and granulation tissue combined with full-&#173;thickness skin grafts and tarsorrhaphy help minimize eyelid scarring and ectropion. Burned ocular tissue can be temporarily protected by covering the eye with a lubricant and a piece of sterile plastic wrap. Amniotic membrane grafts may also be considered. Topical corticosteroids help suppress associated inflammation, but they can also inhibit corneal wound healing and increase the risk of infection. For this reason, they must be used with caution and, in general, for short periods.</p>
					<p class="h3">Cold</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transient corneal stromal edema induced by cold has been reported in a variety of settings, including prolonged exposure to cold when skiing or mountain climbing. Cold temperatures adversely affect the pump function of the endothelial cells, rendering it less effective. Individuals with Raynaud disease and &#173;those with cranial nerve V dysfunction may be especially susceptible.</p>
					<p class="h2">UV&#160;Radiation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal epithelium is susceptible to injury from natu&#173;ral and mechanically produced UV radiation. Common &#173;causes of UV-&#173;radiation injury to the eye are arc welding and unprotected exposure to sunlamps or tanning beds. Prolonged outdoor exposure to reflected sunlight, or <span class="italic">snow blindness,</span> occurs in skiers and mountain climbers at high elevations, where &#173;there is less atmospheric diffraction of UV radiation. Medical use of UV light such as PUVA (psoralen and UVA) and corneal crosslinking in thin corneas can result in iatrogenic endothelial injury (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Patients with ocular UV-&#173;radiation injuries pre&#173;sent with eyelid edema, conjunctival hyperemia, and diffuse punctate keratitis. Treatment options are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">pressure patching to minimize discomfort from eyelid movement</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">placement of a &#173;bandage contact lens</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">placement of an amniotic membrane ring or graft</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">topical antibiotic ointment or eyedrop therapy</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">topical cycloplegia</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">oral analgesics</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Complete epithelial healing usually occurs within 24–72 hours. Appropriate protection with UV-&#173;blocking glasses can help protect the patient from repeated injuries.</p>
					<p class="h2">Ionizing Radiation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exposure to ionizing radiation may occur with UV light, &#173;x-rays, gamma rays, medical imaging equipment, nuclear explosions, and radioisotopes. The level of exposure is related to the amount of energy in the ionizing radiation, the type of rays emitted, the duration of exposure, and the patient’s proximity to the ionizing source. Tissue destruction may result from direct killing of cells, cellular DNA changes that produce lethal or other mutations, or radiation damage to blood vessels with secondary ischemic necrosis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Ionizing radiation can damage the conjunctiva, cornea, and occasionally the lacrimal glands. Conjunctival edema occurs acutely, often followed by scarring, shrinkage, loss of tear production, and alterations in conjunctival blood vessels with telangiectasia. Necrosis of the conjunctiva and under&#173;lying sclera can occur if radioactive material (or a radiomimetic agent such as mitomycin C) is embedded in the conjunctiva. Punctate corneal epithelial erosions are also noted acutely. Explosions involving ionizing radiation may lead to perforation of ocular tissues with immediate radiation necrosis.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Poor wound healing is a hallmark of ionizing radiation injuries.</span> Late complications are related to decreased tear production, loss of corneal stem cells, loss of conjunctival and scleral vascularity, scleral melt, loss of corneal sensation, sloughing of corneal epithelial cells, and per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects. Secondary microbial keratitis, vascularization, and ocular surface disease can result from dry eyes and compromised epithelial cells.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The first step in management of acute radiation injury is the removal of all foreign bodies. In mild cases, ocular surface stabilization may occur with the use of artificial tears or a &#173;bandage contact lens. In more severe cases the following options can be considered:</p>

				<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
					<p class="h2-h1">Insect and Arachnid Injuries</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bee and wasp stings to the cornea and/or conjunctiva cause conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis acutely, sometimes associated with severe pain, corneal edema, stromal infiltration, and subsequent decreased vision. The considerable variation in the acute response results from differences in the quantity of the venom injected and &#173;whether the reaction is primarily toxic or immunologic. In rare instances, other sequelae have been documented, including hyphema, lenticular opacities, anterior uveitis, secondary glaucoma, and heterochromia. Initial therapy with topical cycloplegics, topical (and occasionally systemic) corticosteroids, and topical antibiotics is beneficial. Removal of externalized stingers may be attempted. &#173;After the acute episode, retained stingers may remain inert in the cornea for years.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Caterpillar and tarantula hairs <span class="italic">(urticating hairs)</span> may also become embedded in the cornea and conjunctiva. &#173;These hairs are very fine and usually cannot be removed manually. &#173;Because of their structure, &#173;these urticating hairs tend to migrate more deeply into ocular tissues and elicit a localized granulomatous inflammatory response <span class="italic">(ophthalmia </span><span class="italic">nodosum)</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-11">Fig&#160;15-11</span>).

					<p class="body-text">Calcium oxalate crystals released from crunching the leaves of common &#173;house&#173;plants in the genus <span class="italic">Dieffenbachia</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-12">Fig&#160;15-12A</span>) can cause irritation and microtrauma to the cornea and lead to keratoconjunctivitis. The crystals cause a foreign-&#173;body sensation and are difficult to see on slit-&#173;lamp examination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-12B</span>).

			<p class="h1">Blunt Trauma</p>
				<div id="Chapt15_Top4">
					<p class="h2-h1">Subconjunctival Hemorrhage</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A subconjunctival hemorrhage, blood beneath the conjunctiva, is heralded by an alarming bright red appearance against the sclera (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-13">Fig&#160;15-13</span>). Subconjunctival hemorrhage rarely has an identifiable cause. Occasionally, a history of vomiting, trauma, coughing, constipation, or other activities involving repeated Valsalva maneuvers can be elicited. Vigorous eye rubbing and prolonged head-&#173;down position are risk &#173;factors as well. When subconjunctival hemorrhage is associated with trauma, ruptured globe injury must be ruled out, particularly when the hemorrhage is extensive and raised. Repeated episodes of spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage should prompt a careful systemic medical evaluation for pos&#173;si&#173;ble bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, lymphatic malformation (also called <span class="italic">lymphangioma</span>), amyloidosis, and the use of medi&#173;cations that increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Typically, no therapy is necessary for the hemorrhage; it usually resolves in 1<span class="figdash">‒</span>2 weeks, and the patient simply requires reassurance that the condition is not serious. If the hemorrhage elevates the limbal conjunctiva significantly, dellen may occur. Patients should be warned that the hemorrhage may spread around the circumference of the globe before it resolves and that it may change from red to yellow during its dissolution.</p>
					<p class="h2">Corneal Involvement</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma to the cornea can result in abrasions, edema, tears in Descemet membrane (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-14">Fig&#160;15-14;</span> also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>, Figs&#160;7-10B and 7-11), and corneoscleral lacerations, usually located at the limbus or at the insertion of the extraocular muscles. Traumatic posterior annular keratopathy or corneal endothelial rings have also been described; &#173;these rings are whitish gray and occur directly posterior to the traumatic impact. The endothelial rings appear within several hours of a contusive injury and usually dis&#173;appear within a few days.</p>
					<p class="h3">Corneal abrasion</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disruption of the corneal epithelium is usually associated with immediate pain, foreign-&#173;body sensation, tearing, and discomfort with blinking. Occasionally, a patient may not recall a definite history of trauma but still pre&#173;sents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a corneal abrasion. A slit-&#173;lamp examination is essential in determining (1) the presence and extent of the epithelial defect; and (2) &#173;whether stromal loss is pre&#173;sent. Fluorescein staining is also helpful in determining the presence of an epithelial defect (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>), although a corneal abrasion associated with significant stromal edema may not stain as brightly as expected with fluorescein. A corneal abrasion has sharply defined edges, &#173;little to no associated inflammation (when seen acutely), and no stromal thinning, in contrast to a corneal ulcer, which is characterized by opacification and breakdown of the stromal matrix with pos&#173;si&#173;ble thinning.</p>
					<p class="body-text">It is impor&#173;tant to rule out a foreign body as the cause of the abrasion. Associated traumatic stromal keratitis can cause symptoms of photophobia and reduced vision even &#173;after the abrasion has healed. Herpes simplex virus keratitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis, particularly in a poorly healing epithelial defect. In patients with a painless corneal abrasion, a neurotrophic corneal condition or topical anesthetic misuse should be considered.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A recurrent erosion (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>) is often incited by a corneal abrasion caused by a fingernail, piece of paper, or tree branch.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Management of a corneal abrasion involves infection prevention and pain control. The following points are impor&#173;tant to remember in managing a patient with a corneal abrasion:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">Topical antibiotic drops or ointment can prevent infection, especially in patients who wear contact lenses. (The possibility of nonbacterial infections should be considered based on the cause of the abrasion.)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Pressure patching can relieve pain from an abrasion by immobilizing the upper eyelid, preventing rubbing against the corneal defect. Topical antibiotic ointment is commonly applied prior to patching. However, patching is not necessary for most abrasions, and some patients may find patches and obstructed vision disturbing.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">An alternative to pressure patching is use of a &#173;bandage contact lens, which provides pain relief, facilitates reepithelialization, and allows the patient to see. Patients should use a topical antibiotic drop while wearing a &#173;bandage contact lens.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Cycloplegics can help with associated ciliary spasm. It is impor&#173;tant to choose an agent with an effect that does not exceed the expected duration of ciliary spasm.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used cautiously for pain relief in selected adherent patients during the first 24–48 hours &#173;after injury or diagnosis; however, &#173;these agents can potentially cause local toxicity and delay wound healing.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Topical corticosteroids are not appropriate in patients with corneal abrasion.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Topical anesthetic drops (eg, tetracaine, proparacaine) should not be prescribed for patients with corneal abrasion &#173;because the use of such agents substantially increases the risk of complications, such as delayed epithelial healing and infection.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h2">Traumatic Anterior Uveitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inflammation pre&#173;sent in traumatic anterior uveitis is often associated with decreased vision and perilimbal conjunctival hyperemia. Photophobia, tearing, and ocular pain may occur within 24 hours of injury. The anterior chamber reaction can be surprisingly minimal, given the symptoms of pain and photophobia.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Treatment consists of a topical cycloplegic agent to relieve patient discomfort, as well as topical corticosteroid eyedrops if significant inflammation is pre&#173;sent. Once the anterior uveitis has diminished, cycloplegia may be discontinued, and topical corticosteroids should be tapered slowly to prevent rebound anterior uveitis. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> for further discussion of uveitis.</p>
					<p class="h2">Traumatic Mydriasis and Miosis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Traumatic mydriasis</span> results from iris sphincter tears that can permanently dilate or other&#173;wise alter the shape of the pupil (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-15">Fig&#160;15-15</span>). The iris tears may result in a hyphema. The pupil changes are generally permanent; patients are encouraged to use sunglasses for resultant photophobia. The clinician can consider surgical correction using an artificial iris if the defect is large or an iris suture if it is smaller. Iris diaphragm (painted) contact lenses are also available.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Miosis tends to be associated with anterior chamber inflammation. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops to reduce inflammation and cycloplegia to prevent formation of posterior synechiae are helpful in controlling symptoms.</p>

					<p class="h2">Iridodialysis and Cyclodialysis</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Iridodialysis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma may cause iridodialysis, or traumatic separation of the iris root from the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-16">Fig&#160;15-16</span>). Anterior segment hemorrhage often ensues, and the iridodialysis may not be recognized &#173;until the hyphema has cleared. A small iridodialysis requires no treatment. A large iridodialysis may cause polycoria and monocular diplopia, requiring surgical repair (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-17">Fig&#160;15-17</span>). <span class="keypoint_underline">If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the iridodialysis should be repaired within a few weeks of the injury, as prolonged contracture of the radial iris fibers may prevent a round pupil &#173;after normal iris anatomy is reestablished.</span></p>

					<p class="h3">Cyclodialysis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic cyclodialysis is characterized by separation of the ciliary body from its attachment to the scleral spur, resulting in a cleft. A hyphema may result from the tearing of the tissue. On gonioscopic examination, this cleft appears as a gap at the posterior edge of the scleral spur from posterior displacement of the ciliary body band. Sclera may be vis&#173;i&#173;ble through the gap. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography can be useful in identifying the location and extent of the cyclodialysis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-18">Fig&#160;15-18</span>). A cyclodialysis cleft can cause increased uveoscleral outflow, leading to chronic hypotony and macular edema. Conversely, late scarring of the cleft, which typically occurs 90 days &#173;after the injury, can result in an increase in IOP. If treatment with topical cycloplegics is not effective, closure may be attempted using &#173;laser therapy, diathermy, cryotherapy, or direct suturing. If repair is necessary, it should be performed &#173;after resolution of the hyphema.</p>
					<p class="h2">Traumatic Hyphema</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic hyphema usually occurs in young men; this demographic experiences more ocular trauma than any other. Trauma &#173;causes posterior displacement of the lens–&#173;iris interface with equatorial scleral expansion. The increase in equatorial dia&#173;meter stretches the major iris arterial circle, arterial branches of the ciliary body, and/or recurrent choroidal arteries and veins. The hyphema results from injury to the vessels of the peripheral iris, iris sphincter, or anterior ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-19">Fig&#160;15-19</span>). The extent of the bleeding may vary from a few circulating red blood cells observed on slit-&#173;lamp examination (microscopic hyphema; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-20">Fig&#160;15-20</span>) to a clot in the anterior chamber (layered hyphema; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-21">Fig&#160;15-21</span>) or to bleeding so severe that it fills the anterior chamber completely. <span class="keypoint_underline">The prognosis for traumatic hy</span><span class="keypoint_underline">phema is generally good and is &#173;independent of the size of the hyphema, provided that no additional complications are pre&#173;sent.</span> Even <span class="italic">total,</span> or <span class="italic">eight-&#173;ball, hyphemas</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-22">Fig&#160;15-22</span>) can resolve without sequelae. Traumatic hyphema is frequently associated with corneal abrasion, anterior uveitis, and mydriasis, as well as with injuries to the &#173;angle structures, lens, posterior segment, and orbit.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Spontaneous hyphema</span> (ie, a hyphema that occurs without any history of trauma) is much less common and should alert the clinician to the possibility of rubeosis iridis (typically related to central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion and/or diabetic retinopathy), clotting abnormalities, herpetic disease, or iris chafing from a sulcus-&#173;placed intraocular lens. In &#173;children, spontaneous hyphema is associated with juvenile xanthogranuloma, retinoblastoma, iris vascular hamartomas, and leukemia.</p>
					<p class="h3">Rebleeding</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The greatest concern &#173;after a traumatic hyphema is rebleeding, which occurs in less than 5% of cases. <span class="keypoint_underline">Rebleeding is usually seen between 3 and 7 days &#173;after injury as a result of clot lysis and retraction.</span> A complication associated with rebleeding is elevated IOP (in 50% of patients), which can potentially lead to glaucoma and optic atrophy.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Corneal blood staining may result from the combination of blood in the anterior chamber, corneal endothelial damage, and elevated IOP (Fig&#160;15-23A).</span> Red blood cells within the anterior chamber release hemoglobin that penetrates the posterior corneal stroma, where it is absorbed by keratocytes. Within the keratocytes, breakdown of the hemoglobin into hemosiderin can result in the death of the keratocytes. Close observation at the slit lamp may reveal early blood staining as yellow granular changes and reduced fibrillar definition in the posterior corneal stroma. Blood staining can lead to a reduction in corneal transparency that may be permanent. On histologic examination, red blood cells and their breakdown products can be seen within the corneal stroma. Corneal blood staining often clears slowly, starting in the periphery (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-23">Fig&#160;15-23B</span>), which poses a prob&#173;lem in &#173;children at risk of amblyopia.</p>
					<p class="h3">Sickle cell complications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a traumatic hyphema develops in an African American patient, a sickle cell workup should be performed to investigate the possibility of sickle cell hemoglobinopathy. Patients with sickle cell disease and carriers of the sickle cell trait are predisposed to sickling of red blood cells in the anterior chamber. &#173;Because sickle cells have restricted outflow through the trabecular meshwork, they may raise IOP dramatically. In addition, the optic nerve seems to be at greater risk of damage in patients with sickle cell disease, even &#173;those with modest IOP elevation, presumably as a result of a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The clinician must make &#173;every effort to control elevated IOP in &#173;these patients. <span class="keypoint_underline">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and osmotic agents reduce aqueous pH and lead to hemoconcentration, both of which may exacerbate sickling of red blood cells. For this reason, the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is avoided in patients with sickle cell disease.</span> Surgical intervention is recommended if average IOP remains 25&#160;mm Hg or higher during the first 24 hours &#173;after the initial hyphema or if &#173;there are repeated, transient elevations, with IOP higher than 30&#160;mm Hg for 2–4 days, despite medical intervention.</p>

The irrigation procedure can be repeated. If irrigation is not successful, the irrigation/aspiration handpiece, used in cataract surgery, may be effective. In severe cases, the use of a cutting instrument or intraocular diathermy may be necessary.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Penetrating and Perforating Ocular Trauma</p>
				<div id="Chapt15_Top5">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is impor&#173;tant to understand the difference between a penetrating wound and a perforating wound for accurate communication and documentation. In a <span class="italic">penetrating wound,</span> a foreign body passes <span class="italic">into</span> an anatomical structure; in a <span class="italic">perforating wound,</span> a foreign body passes <span class="italic">through</span> such a structure. In a penetrating corneal injury, an object enters but does not pass all the way through the cornea, as in the case of a metallic foreign body that enters the corneal stroma but lodges anterior to Descemet membrane. In a perforating corneal injury, an object passes through the cornea and lodges in the anterior chamber. A perforating corneal foreign-&#173;body injury can also be called a <span class="italic">penetrating ocular injury</span> if the foreign body passes through the cornea but does not exit through the globe. In a <span class="italic">perforating ocular injury,</span> the foreign body enters and exits the globe.</p>
					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Conjunctival Laceration</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When managing conjunctival lacerations associated with trauma, the physician must be certain that the deeper structures of the eye have not been damaged and that no foreign body is pre&#173;sent. &#173;After a topical anesthetic has been applied, the physician can explore the conjunctival laceration with sterile forceps or cotton-&#173;tipped applicators at the slit lamp. If it is still unclear &#173;whether the globe has been penetrated, exploration in the operating room can be considered. If it is obvious that globe integrity has been &#173;violated, exploration at the slit lamp should be &#173;limited and the patient prepared for surgical repair. In general, small linear conjunctival lacerations do not need to be sutured. However, stellate conjunctival lacerations, lacerations with bare sclera exposed, or lacerations with lost or retracted conjunctival tissue &#173;will heal faster if sutured closed.</p>
					<p class="h2">Conjunctival Foreign Bodies</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Foreign bodies on the conjunctival surface are best recognized during slit-&#173;lamp evaluation. Foreign bodies can lodge in the cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac, or they may be located on the palpebral conjunctival surface of the upper eyelid (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-9"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-24">Fig&#160;15-24</span>
					). If a patient is experiencing foreign-&#173;body sensation, topical fluorescein can be instilled to check for the fine, vertical, linear corneal abrasions characteristic of retained foreign bodies on the eyelid margin or superior tarsal plate (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-25">Fig&#160;15-25</span>). Foreign &#173;matter embedded in tissue can be removed with a sterile, disposable hypodermic needle. Glass particles, cactus spines, and insect hairs are often difficult to see, but a careful search of the cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac with high magnification aids in identification and removal. &#173;These foreign bodies may be removed with fine-&#173;tipped jeweler’s forceps or a blunt spatula. If a foreign body is suspected but not seen, the cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac can be irrigated and wiped with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator moistened with topical anesthetic. Double eversion of the eyelid with a Desmarres retractor or a bent paper clip may be necessary to allow the examiner to effectively search the entire arc of the superior cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;15-2</span>; also see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-9</span>).</p>

Gunpowder or carbon fragments, such as &#173;those that may be embedded in the conjunctiva by a blast injury, should be removed if pos&#173;si&#173;ble. &#173;Because deeper fragments may be well tolerated, &#173;there is no need for extensive “digging” in an effort to achieve complete removal.</p>

					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Glass foreign bodies</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients with glass or fiberglass foreign bodies, all exposed glass fragments should be removed. Fragments deeply embedded in the cornea are often inert and can be left in place (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-26">Fig&#160;15-26</span>). Careful gonioscopic evaluation of the anterior chamber is essential to ensure that the iris and the &#173;angle are &#173;free of any retained glass particles.

					<p class="h3">Iron foreign bodies</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iron foreign bodies embedded in the cornea for more than a few hours can result in an orange-&#173;brown “rust ring” (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-27">Fig&#160;15-27</span>). Corneal iron foreign bodies and rust rings can usually be removed at the slit lamp with a disposable (25-&#173; or 26-&#173;gauge) hypodermic needle or “spud” instrument, &#173;after application of a topical anesthetic (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;15-3</span>). A battery-&#173;powered dental burr with a sterile tip may also be utilized; however, the rotating burr can cause excessive tissue disruption and increased scar formation. A foreign body that enters the corneal stroma deep to Bowman layer always results in some degree of scar formation. When such scars occur in the visual axis, they may result in glare and decreased vision from irregular astigmatism. Minimal disruption of Bowman layer during foreign-&#173;body removal helps minimize scarring and obstruction of the visual axis; this may mean retaining small amounts of the metallic foreign body.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a patient pre&#173;sents with both ocular and systemic trauma, diagnosis and treatment of any life-&#173;threatening injury takes &#173;precedence over evaluation and management of the ophthalmic injury. Once the patient is medically stable, the ophthalmologist should elicit a complete history, including past ocular history. The diagnosis of a traumatic ocular injury may be obvious from casual examination of the eye. However, a thorough history of the nature of the injury is crucial and should include questions regarding any association with the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">metal-&#173;on-&#173;metal strike</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">high-&#173;velocity projectile</li>

						<li class="bullet-list-mid">involvement of a sharp object</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">lack of eye protection</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h3">Examination</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaluation of a patient with a traumatic ocular injury includes a complete general and ophthalmic examination. As soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the examiner should determine and rec&#173;ord visual acuity, which is the most reliable predictor of final visual outcome in traumatized eyes. Pupillary examination is then performed to detect the presence of an afferent pupillary defect (including a reverse Marcus Gunn response; see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>) or abnormality in pupil size or contour. The pupil may be peaked &#173;toward an area of corneal or scleral perforation. The examiner then looks for key signs that are suggestive or diagnostic of a penetrating or perforating ocular injury (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 15-4">&#173;Table&#160;15-4</span>).</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">When a significant perforating injury is suspected, it is impor&#173;tant to avoid forced duction testing, gonioscopy, tonometry, and scleral depression.</span> It is also impor&#173;tant to instruct the patient to avoid straining, squeezing their eyelids, or touching the eye, and a metal shield should be secured over the eye. Ancillary tests that may be useful in this setting are summarized in 
					<!--<span class="xref-table" id="Table 15-5">&#173;Table&#160;15-5</span>-->
					<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-5</span>
					. All cases should be managed with safeguards appropriate for patients known to have blood-&#173;borne infections.</p>
					<p class="h2">Nonsurgical Management</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some perforating injuries are so minimal that they seal spontaneously before ophthalmic examination, with no intraocular damage, iris prolapse, or adherence. &#173;These cases may require only systemic and/or topical antibiotic therapy along with close observation. Small, nongaping wounds may be treated as corneal abrasions with pressure patching or a &#173;bandage contact lens &#173;until the epithelial defect has resolved and the patient is comfortable.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If a corneal wound is leaking (ie, the Seidel test result is positive; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>, Fig&#160;2-7) but the anterior chamber remains formed, the clinician can attempt to repair the leak with the following interventions, &#173;either alone or in combination:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">pharmacologic aqueous suppression (topical or systemic)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">pressure patching</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">therapeutic contact lens</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">tissue adhesive</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Generally, if &#173;these &#173;measures fail to seal the wound within 2 days, suture closure is recommended. If the corneal wound is leaking in the presence of a very shallow or flat anterior chamber, urgent surgical repair is required.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When a foreign body is pre&#173;sent, management of the corneal perforation can be challenging. Descemet membrane is a strong structural barrier to perforation of the cornea; foreign bodies may penetrate through the stroma and lodge anterior to Descemet membrane. It may be difficult to determine &#173;whether removal of a deep foreign body &#173;will dislodge a self-&#173;sealed wound, so judicious decision making is mandatory. If multiple, very small foreign bodies are seen in the deep stroma (as may occur &#173;after an explosion) with no resultant inflammation or sign of infection, the patient may be monitored closely, given that removal of &#173;every particle may be unnecessary. If anterior chamber entry is pre&#173;sent or suspected, the foreign body can be removed in the operating room. Overly aggressive attempts to remove deeply embedded foreign bodies at the slit lamp may cause leakage of aqueous humor and collapse of the anterior chamber and could dislodge the foreign body into the anterior chamber.</p>
					<p class="h2">Surgical Management</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Preoperative management</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When surgical repair is required, the timing of the operation is crucial. Although studies have not documented any disadvantage in delaying the repair of an open globe for up to 24 hours, intervention ideally should occur as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Prompt wound closure to restore the integrity of the globe helps minimize the risk of additional damage to intraocular contents, inflammation, microbial proliferation, and endophthalmitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Before proceeding to the operating room, it is impor&#173;tant that the clinician</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">apply a protective shield over the injured eye</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">avoid excessive manipulation of the eye</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">instruct the patient not to eat or drink</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">prescribe appropriate medi&#173;cations for sedation and pain control once surgical consent has been signed</li>

					<p class="body-text">Injuries associated with soil contamination and/or retained intraocular foreign bodies increase the risk of <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> endophthalmitis. &#173;Because this organism can destroy the eye within 24 hours, intravenous and/or intravitreal therapy with an antibiotic effective against <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species may be necessary; fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin), clindamycin, or vancomycin can be considered.

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="keypoint_underline">General anesthesia is almost always preferred for repair of an open globe &#173;because retrobulbar or peribulbar anesthetic injection increases posterior orbital pressure, which may cause or exacerbate the extrusion of intraocular contents.</span> Local or topical anesthesia may be considered in rare instances, such as in a patient with a small laceration who is at medical risk from general anesthesia. &#173;After the surgical repair is complete, a periocular anesthetic injection may be used to control postoperative pain.</p>
					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Surgical repair considerations</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Management of a typical full-&#173;thickness corneoscleral laceration with uveal prolapse generally requires surgical repair in the operating room (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-29">Fig&#160;15-29</span>). Repair of a corneoscleral laceration takes &#173;precedence over non–&#173;life-&#173;threatening surgical prob&#173;lems elsewhere on the body. Repair of an adnexal injury follows repair of the globe itself &#173;because eyelid surgery can put pressure on an open globe, and certain eyelid lacerations may actually improve exposure of the globe during surgery. The primary goal of the repair is to restore the integrity of the globe. The secondary goal at the time of the primary repair or during subsequent procedures is to restore vision. The surgeon is encouraged not to overpromise or be overly optimistic about the outcome in this setting. &#173;Because subsequent operations may be required, this procedure might be described as eye-&#173;saving rather than sight-&#173;saving surgery.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Primary enucleation or evisceration is recommended only for an injury so devastating that restoration of the anatomy is impossible, or when it would be impor&#173;tant to spare the patient another procedure. Before the operation is performed in such a case, it is helpful to add “and pos&#173;si&#173;ble enucleation” to the consent form. Delay in enucleation following attempted repair with subsequent loss of light perception allows the patient time to acknowledge both loss of vision and accompanying disfigurement, as well as to thoughtfully consider the benefits of enucleation in a nonemergency setting.</p>

					<p class="h3">Repair of a corneoscleral laceration</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If vitreous or lens fragments have prolapsed through the corneal wound, the surgeon cuts &#173;these fragments flush with the surface of the globe (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-30">Fig&#160;15-30</span>), taking care not to exert traction on the vitreous or zonular fibers. If uvea or &#173;retina (seen as translucent, tan tissue with extremely fine vessels) protrudes, the surgeon reposits it using a cannula or spatula in a gentle sweeping motion through a separate limbal incision, while keeping the anterior chamber formed with viscoelastic. If epithelium has obviously migrated onto a uveal surface or into the wound, the surgeon can attempt to peel the epithelial layer off. Only in cases of frankly necrotic macerated tissue should uveal tissue be excised.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The limbus is an impor&#173;tant landmark for suturing a corneoscleral laceration. The limbus is sutured before the rest of the wound with 9-0 or 10-0 nylon suture, followed by closure of the remaining corneal components of the laceration with 10-0 nylon suture. The wound is divided in half with each successive suture &#173;until watertight closure is achieved. It may be necessary to reposit iris tissue repeatedly &#173;after each suture is placed in order to avoid entrapment of iris in the wound. A side port incision is of &#173;great utility during surgical repair for sweeping the iris from the wound and reforming the anterior chamber, thus reducing manipulation of the traumatic wound. Despite &#173;these efforts, uvea may remain apposed to the posterior corneal surface. Superficial sutures may be helpful at this stage of closure to avoid incorporating the uvea into the wound closure. Once watertight, the uvea can be separated from the cornea with viscoelastic injection, followed by replacement of the superficial sutures with near–&#173;full-&#173;thickness sutures. It is best to bury suture knots to provide postoperative comfort. Viscoelastic is removed, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, prior to a final test of wound integrity to reduce the risk of a postoperative IOP spike. Testing wound integrity when the eye is filled with air or viscoelastic does not guarantee a watertight closure.</p>
					<p class="body-text">It may be impossible to achieve a watertight closure &#173;because of unusual laceration configuration or loss of tissue. In such cases, X-&#173;shaped or purse-&#173;string sutures or other customized techniques may suffice. When watertight closure cannot be achieved, cyanoacrylate glue or even primary lamellar keratoplasty may be required. A &#173;bandage contact lens over the glue is necessary for comfort. A conjunctival flap or amniotic tissue graft should not be used to treat a wound leak.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When the anatomy of the wound allows, specific suturing techniques may be helpful in restoring a more normal corneal contour. Longer, compressive sutures create flattening in the area of the suture and are therefore placed in the peripheral cornea to re-&#173;create the aspheric curvature of the cornea (flatter in the periphery and steeper centrally). Shorter, more closely spaced sutures are then used centrally, when pos&#173;si&#173;ble, in order to close the wound without excessive central flattening (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-31">Figs&#160;15-31, 15-32</span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-32"></span>
					). When the sutures are being tied, it is impor&#173;tant to have sufficient tension to create a watertight closure without inducing corneal striae, astigmatism, or maceration of the inflamed stromal tissue. Nevertheless, establishing wound integrity takes &#173;precedence over concerns about induced astigmatism.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The scleral component of the laceration is evaluated with a gentle peritomy and conjunctival separation in order to expose the wound. Prolapsed vitreous is excised, and prolapsed nonnecrotic uvea and &#173;retina are reposited. The scleral wound is closed with 9-0 nylon or 8-0 nylon. Often, resection of Tenon capsule and management of prolapsed tissue must be repeated incrementally &#173;after each suture is placed.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When the laceration might extend &#173;under an extraocular muscle, the muscle may be carefully detached at its insertion &#173;after preplacing a suture and then reinserted following repair. Closure of the laceration should continue posteriorly only to the point at which it becomes technically difficult or requires undue pressure on the globe to complete. Very posterior lacerations may be tamponaded effectively by orbital tissue and are best left alone.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The decision of &#173;whether to perform additional intraocular surgery during the primary repair is made once the globe has become watertight. The surgeon must decide &#173;whether intraocular surgery is needed and if so, &#173;whether it should be attempted immediately or postponed. &#173;Factors to consider include the expertise of the surgeon, the quality of the fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty and experience of nursing personnel, the availability of technical equipment and instruments, the adequacy of the view of anterior segment structures, and issues of informed consent. If &#173;there are concerns about any of &#173;these &#173;factors, the surgeon should restore globe integrity and postpone the secondary procedures &#173;until a &#173;later date. For example, an anterior segment surgeon might not attempt a lens extraction with &#173;limited visualization. When removal of opacified lens material is being attempted, it is helpful to know &#173;whether the posterior capsule has been &#173;violated. Thus, removal of a ruptured lens may be performed from a posterior approach with vitrectomy during a second procedure. See BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> for further discussion of the issues of cataract surgery and intraocular lens placement &#173;after ocular trauma.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If a foreign body is vis&#173;i&#173;ble in the anterior segment and can be grasped, it is reasonable to remove it, &#173;either through the wound or through a separate limbal incision. Metal fragments are difficult to remove through their entrance wounds &#173;because the rough metal edges usually require a larger wound for extraction than would appear necessary (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-33">Fig&#160;15-33</span>). A retained intraocular metallic foreign body can cause ocular siderosis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 15-34">Fig&#160;15-34</span>); yellow discoloration of the endothelium and deep stroma is vis&#173;i&#173;ble. Removal of the foreign body can ameliorate the discoloration (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;15-4</span>). If left untreated, ocular siderosis can cause permanent damage to the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium and inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers and ultimately induce optic nerve atrophy. A retained copper foreign body may result in a severe inflammatory reaction (chalcosis) and should be removed.</p>

					<p class="body-text">At the conclusion of the repair, prophylactic intraoperative antibiotics may be given by subconjunctival injection to cover both gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative organisms. For contaminated wounds involving the vitreous, intravitreal antibiotics such as vancomycin 1&#160;mg and ceftazidime 2.25&#160;mg can be considered.</p>
					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Postoperative management</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperatively, therapy is directed at preventing infection, suppressing inflammation, controlling IOP, and relieving pain. Patients may be given intravenous antibiotics (eg, a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside) for 48 hours or an oral antibiotic with good vitreous penetration, such as moxifloxacin. Topical antibiotics are generally instilled &#173;until epithelial closure of the ocular surface is complete. Topical corticosteroids may be given, depending on the amount of inflammation or the risk of infection. Corticosteroid eyedrops and cycloplegics are slowly tapered as the inflammation subsides. A fibrinous response in the anterior chamber may respond well to a short course of systemic prednisone. IOP should be monitored, and elevated IOP should be controlled to minimize the risk of optic nerve damage. Postoperative hypotony may be associated with choroidal effusion or intraocular hemorrhage and should prompt evaluation for wound leak, cyclodialysis cleft, or ciliary body shutdown due to inflammation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Corneal sutures that do not loosen spontaneously are generally left in place for at least 3 months, depending on wound healing and patient age, and then removed incrementally over the next few months. In &#173;children, sutures can be removed as early as 6–8 weeks. In general, wounds near the limbus heal faster than wounds in the paracentral cornea. Fibrosis and vascularization are indicators that enough healing has occurred to render suture removal safe. Loose sutures can be identified by applying fluorescein at each postoperative visit and looking for erosion through the epithelium. Loose sutures do not provide structural support and should be removed &#173;because of increased risk of infection and inflammation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Injured eyes are at increased risk of choroidal effusion or ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, so frequent examination of the posterior segment is essential. If media opacity precludes an adequate fundus examination, evaluation for an afferent pupillary defect and B-&#173;scan ultrasonography are useful tools for monitoring ret&#173;i&#173;nal status.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Refraction and vision correction with contact lenses or glasses can proceed when the ocular surface and media are clear. Once the wound is adequately healed, partial or complete suture removal can be performed to facilitate improvement in vision. &#173;Because of the risk of amblyopia in a child or loss of fusion in an adult, vision correction should not be unnecessarily delayed. The uninvolved eye of a child at risk of amblyopia should be patched as soon as the first postoperative day.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Also, once the wound has healed, a rigid gas-&#173;permeable contact lens can create a new refractive surface and may help improve vision. For cases of reduced vision due to corneal opacity, marked irregular astigmatism, or endothelial failure, keratoplasty may be considered (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Patients with monocular vision (due to one poorly functioning eye) should be prescribed glasses with polycarbonate lenses to protect their functioning eye.</p>

Blunt force applied to the eye displaces the aqueous volume peripherally, causing an increase in hydraulic pressure at the lens, iris root, and trabecular meshwork. If this “wedge of pressure” exceeds the tensile strength of the ocular structures, the vessels in the peripheral iris and the anterior ciliary body may rupture, leading to hyphema. The force may cause scleral ruptures, typically at the limbus and posterior to the rectus muscle insertions, where the sclera is thinner and unsupported by the orbital bones. Severe trauma leads to lens subluxation, ret&#173;i&#173;nal dialysis, optic nerve avulsion, and/or vitreous hemorrhage. <span class="figure-source-note">(Illustration by Cyndie&#160;C.&#160;H.&#160;Wooley.)</span></p>
