			<p class="h1">Degenerations and Depositions of the Conjunctiva</p>
				<div  id="Chapt6_Top1">
					<p class="h2-h1">Age-&#173;Related Changes</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a result of aging, the conjunctiva loses transparency and becomes thinner. The <span class="italic">substantia propria</span> (stroma) becomes less elastic, causing conjunctival laxity. In older individuals, the conjunctival vessels may become more prominent. The vessels may show saccular telangiectasias, fusiform dilatory changes, or tortuosities. &#173;These changes are not necessarily uniform; they tend to be more pronounced in the region of the interpalpebral zone (also called <span class="italic">interpalpebral</span> or <span class="italic">palpebral fissure</span>), corresponding to the area most exposed to the environment.</p>
					<p class="h2">Pinguecula</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> A pinguecula is a common conjunctival condition that occurs typically on the nasal side of the bulbar conjunctiva, adjacent to the limbus in the interpalpebral zone. It is usually bilateral and appears as a yellowish elevated mass (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 6-1">Fig&#160;6-1</span>), which may gradually enlarge. Affected patients may have recurrent inflammatory episodes known as <span class="italic">pingueculitis</span><span class="h5-text_italic">.</span></p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Pingueculae occur as a result of the effects of aging, UV light exposure, and environmental insults such as dust and wind. Histologic examination demonstrates elastotic degeneration (the material stains for elastin but is not broken down by elastase) of subepithelial collagen with hyalinized connective tissue.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Topical lubrication to alleviate ocular irritation associated with pingueculitis is the mainstay of treatment. For patients with associated inflammation, judicious use of topical corticosteroids may be considered; however, long-&#173;term corticosteroid therapy for pingueculae is strongly discouraged &#173;because of the associated adverse effects. Excision is indicated when pingueculae become chronically inflamed, are refractory to topical therapy, or interfere with contact lens wear. Excision is not typically performed for cosmesis.</p>
					<p class="h2">Pterygium</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> A pterygium is a wing-&#173;shaped fibrovascular growth of conjunctiva that extends onto the superficial nasal and/or temporal cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-2">Fig&#160;6-2</span>). As the pterygium progresses &#173;toward the visual axis, it induces visually significant regular and irregular astigmatism and scarring. Patients may report ocular irritation. A pigmented iron line <span class="h5-text_italic">(Stocker line)</span> may be seen in the corneal epithelium, just central to the edge of the pterygium (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-3">Fig&#160;6-3</span>). The prevalence of pterygium is higher among &#173;people in equatorial regions and in &#173;people who work or re&#173;create outdoors, owing to increased UV light exposure. The onset of the condition is typically between the ages of 20 and 30&#160;years.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A pterygium must be distinguished from a pseudopterygium, which may occur &#173;after trauma or chemical burns or secondary to inflammatory corneal disease. Calcifications, leukoplakia, aty&#173;pi&#173;cal elevation, irregular feeder vessels, and rapid growth are not typical of pterygia and may alert the clinician to the possibility of a malignancy. High-&#173;resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography can help in differentiating a pterygium from ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Marked thickening of the epithelium, which is typical of OSSN, is not characteristic of pterygia (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-4">Fig&#160;6-4</span>). See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis of pterygium is strongly correlated with UV light exposure, although environmental &#173;factors such as chronic exposure to dust, wind, or other irritants may contribute as well. In addition, &#173;there may be a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition to pterygium development. Histologically, a pterygium is similar to a pinguecula (basophilic degeneration of elastotic fibers), except that a pterygium invades the superficial cornea.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Prophylactic treatment includes wearing UV-&#173;blocking sunglasses and a broad-&#173;brimmed hat, especially for patients chronically exposed to the sun. Medical treatment with artificial tears can alleviate associated ocular irritation. Topical corticosteroids, used on a short-&#173;term basis for pterygia, can be helpful, but long-&#173;term use is not advisable. Excision is indicated if the pterygium decreases vision &#173;because of induced irregular astigmatism, or if the pterygium &#173;causes per&#173;sis&#173;tent irritation, exhibits progressive growth that threatens the visual axis, or restricts ocular motility. Patients in certain occupations (eg, modeling or &#173;television &#173;performance) may desire removal for aesthetic reasons. To reduce the recurrence rate, most clinicians prefer to cover the bare sclera with tissue (eg, conjunctival autograft) at the time of surgery. See <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span> for surgical management.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>In patients with visually significant cataract and pterygium, a staged surgical approach is indicated. Cataract surgery is recommended &#173;after the pterygium is excised and the corneal contour has stabilized (typically 3 months). This approach can lead to improved long-&#173;term refractive results (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-5">Fig&#160;6-5</span>).</p>
					<p class="h2">Conjunctival Concretions</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Concretions are small cystic lesions containing epithelial and keratin debris, glycosaminoglycans (previously called <span class="italic">mucopolysaccharides</span>), and mucin. This common condition is often best seen when the eyelid is everted. Concretions are vis&#173;i&#173;ble as small, yellow-&#173;white dots in the palpebral conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-6">Fig&#160;6-6</span>) of older patients or patients who have had chronic conjunctivitis or meibomian gland dysfunction. Concretions are almost always asymptomatic, but they may erode through the overlying epithelium, causing foreign-&#173;body sensation. When symptomatic, concretions can be easily removed at the slit lamp with topical anesthesia and a 25-&#173;gauge needle.</p>
					<p class="h2">Conjunctival Epithelial Inclusion Cysts</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Conjunctival epithelial inclusion cysts are clear or transilluminating lesions that appear in &#173;either the bulbar conjunctiva or the conjunctival fornix and are typically incidental findings on examination. Conjunctival inclusion cysts can be congenital or acquired. Cysts can also result from chronic inflammation, trauma, or surgery. Dilated lymphatic channels may mimic a chain of inclusion cysts of the bulbar conjunctiva.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Most acquired cysts of the conjunctiva are derived from an inclusion of conjunctival epithelium within the substantia propria. The implanted cells proliferate to form a central fluid-&#173;filled cavity that is lined with nonkeratinized conjunctival epithelium. Conjunctival cysts may also form from the ductal epithelium of accessory lacrimal glands; &#173;these cysts are lined with a double layer of epithelium.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> &#173;Because &#173;these cysts are usually asymptomatic, they generally do not require treatment. If large or elevated, a cyst can cause irritation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-7">Fig&#160;6-7</span>). If the cyst is symptomatic, incision and drainage with a needle at the slit lamp may be attempted; however, the cyst may recur. Piercing the cyst in multiple locations may prevent recurrence (Video&#160;6-1). If the cyst recurs, complete excision may be necessary.</p>

					<p class="h2">Age-&#173;Related Changes</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a result of aging, the cornea gradually becomes flatter in the vertical meridian, thinner, more rigid, and slightly less transparent. Its refractive index increases. Descemet membrane becomes thicker, increasing from 3&#160;µm at birth to 10–12&#160;µm by adulthood. With increasing age, occasional peripheral endothelial guttae, known as <span class="italic">Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies,</span> may form (discussed &#173;later in this chapter). Age-&#173;related attrition of corneal endothelial cells results in a reduction in cell density from about 4000&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span> at birth to about 2300&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span> at 85&#160;years of age.</p>
					<p class="h2">Epithelial and Subepithelial Degenerations and Depositions</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Coats white ring</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coats white ring is a small (<span class="symbol">≤</span>1&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter) circular or oval-&#173;shaped opacity that consists of iron-&#173;containing fibrotic remnants of a metallic foreign body and is vis&#173;i&#173;ble as discrete gray-&#173;white dots in the superficial corneal stroma (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-3"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-8">Fig&#160;6-8</span>
					). Once &#173;these lesions mature and are &#173;free of any associated inflammation, they do not change. Therapy with corticosteroids or other anti-&#173;inflammatory agents is not beneficial. &#173;These lesions should be distinguished from <span class="italic">corneal facets,</span> which are small, gray-&#173;white, epithelium-&#173;filled defects in the anterior stroma.</p>
					<p class="h3">Spheroidal degeneration</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Primary spheroidal degeneration</span> The deposits are bilateral and initially located in the nasal and temporal cornea. With age, they can extend onto the conjunctiva in the interpalpebral zone. In rare cases, generally in childhood, the spheroidal deposits extend across the interpalpebral cornea, producing a noncalcific band-&#173;shaped keratopathy. The primary degeneration is unrelated to coexisting ocular diseases. The etiology is controversial, but cumulative evidence suggests that the deposits may develop from UV radiation–&#173;induced alteration of preexisting structural connective tissue components or from the synthesis of abnormal extracellular material in limbal conjunctiva.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Secondary spheroidal degeneration</span> This degeneration is associated with ocular injury or inflammation. The deposits aggregate near the area of corneal scarring or vascularization. All cases show extracellular proteinaceous, hyaline deposits with characteristics of elastotic degeneration. &#173;These deposits are thought to be secondary to the combined effects of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition, actinic exposure associated with temperature extremes, aging, and perhaps vari&#173;ous environmental &#173;factors, such as dust and wind.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Medical therapy is of &#173;little value, but ocular lubrication may help address uneven layering of the tear film over affected areas. In cases of central corneal involvement, superficial keratectomy, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using an excimer &#173;laser, or lamellar keratoplasty may be indicated.</p>
					<p class="h3">Iron deposition</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iron lines are generally related to pooling of tears near areas of ocular surface irregularity (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-10">Fig&#160;6-10</span>; see also <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-3</span>). The iron is deposited at the level of the basal epithelium. An iron line surrounding an elevated corneal lesion indicates that the lesion has been pre&#173;sent for some time. Visualization of an iron line at the slit lamp is enhanced by using a broad oblique beam or diffuse illumination with the cobalt blue filter before instilling fluorescein.</p>

The <span class="italic">Hudson-&#173;St</span><span class="accent_italic">ä</span><span class="italic">hli line</span> is a linear horizontal opacity generally located at the junction of the upper two-&#173;thirds and lower one-&#173;third of the cornea; it is likely related to pooling of tears on the lower eyelid. Iron lines are also associated with keratorefractive surgery (LASIK line), particularly with radial keratotomy. Vari&#173;ous corneal iron lines are summarized in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 6-3">&#173;Table&#160;6-3</span> and illustrated in <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-11">Figure&#160;6-11</span>. In general, iron lines do not require treatment, although they can alert the clinician to under&#173;lying pathology that may require intervention.</p>
					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Calcific band keratopathy</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Calcific band keratopathy (also called <span class="h5-text_italic">band keratopathy</span>) is a degeneration of the superficial cornea that involves mainly Bowman layer. &#173;These changes are usually first seen peripherally at the 3- and 9-o’clock positions. Eventually, the calcium deposits may coalesce to form a dense horizontal band of plaques or large calcific plates across the interpalpebral zone (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 6-12">Fig&#160;6-12</span>). &#173;There is often a clear zone between the lesion and the limbus. In &#173;later stages, small cracks can occur in the band as a result of fractures in the calcium deposits. In addition, small, lucent holes can be observed throughout the opacity, resembling the appearance of Swiss cheese and resulting from the penetration of corneal nerves through Bowman layer.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Common &#173;causes of band keratopathy are listed in 
					<!--<span class="h5-text_xref-table xref-table" id="Table 6-4">&#173;Table&#160;6-4</span>-->
					<span class="h5-text_xref-table xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-4</span>
					. Band keratopathy begins as fine, dustlike, basophilic deposits at the level of Bowman layer and can be idiopathic, confined to the eye as a consequence of ocular disease, or a manifestation of systemic disease. Band keratopathy may also result from the deposition of urate in the cornea. The urates appear brown, unlike the gray-&#173;white calcium deposits observed in band keratopathy, and they may be associated with gout or hyperuricemia.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> To rule out associated metabolic or renal disease, the clinician may conduct a basic workup in conjunction with the patient’s primary care physician:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">serum calcium/phosphorus/uric acid</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">parathyroid hormone level</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">urinalysis (checking for crystals, pH)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) and serum lysozyme levels (particularly if sarcoidosis is suspected)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">chest &#173;x-ray (if sarcoidosis is suspected)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">To reduce or slow the deposition of calcium, it is impor&#173;tant to treat or control any under&#173;lying conditions, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca or renal failure, to the extent pos&#173;si&#173;ble; this may reduce the recurrence of band keratopathy &#173;after treatment. A combination of mechanical and chemical chelation with a neutral solution of &#173;either disodium or dipotassium EDTA can be used to remove the calcium. A concentration of Na<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>EDTA (0.05&#160;mol/L) 1%–4% can be obtained through a compounding pharmacy. K<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>EDTA can be prepared by the physician by injecting sterile &#173;water into a K<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;EDTA-&#173;containing blood collection tube. The epithelium overlying the calcium is removed before the chelating solution is applied. One option for applying EDTA is to use any cylindrical tube that approximates the dia&#173;meter of the area to be treated as a reservoir to confine the chelating solution. Alternatively, an EDTA-&#173;soaked cellulose sponge can be used to &#173;gently rub the affected area. A &#173;bandage contact lens is left in place and the patient is treated with topical antibiotic and &#173;steroid &#173;until the epithelium has healed. Topical cycloplegia can help control postoperative discomfort.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Occasionally, calcium plaques can form on the cornea, which can cause foreign-&#173;body sensation. &#173;These plaques can be removed at the slit lamp with forceps. Corneal epithelium &#173;will not grow over a calcium plaque. A fibrous pannus may accompany extensive calcific band keratopathy, especially if intracameral silicone oil is the under&#173;lying cause. PTK using an excimer &#173;laser is not advised as primary treatment, &#173;because calcium ablates at a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent rate than stroma, which may result in a severely irregular surface. If &#173;there is residual opacification &#173;after the initial EDTA chelation, PTK may be considered. Band keratopathy can recur if the under&#173;lying ocular or systemic condition persists. EDTA chelation may be repeated for residual opacification or recurrence. Continued follow-up of &#173;these patients is advised.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Salzmann nodular degeneration is often idiopathic. It can also be associated with dry eye, exposure, or long-&#173;standing keratitis (eg, phlyctenulosis, trachoma, or interstitial keratitis); in such cases, the nodules are often observed at the ends of vessels associated with a pannus. The degeneration may not appear &#173;until years &#173;after active keratitis has subsided. In patients who wear hard contact lenses, subepithelial fibrosis can also occur at the 3- and 9-o’clock positions.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A variant of Salzmann nodular degeneration, <span class="italic">peripheral hypertrophic subepithelial corneal degeneration,</span> has also been described (Fig&#160;6-14B). It is most common in &#173;women and is typically bilateral, peripheral, and symmetric. Adjacent superficial limbal vascularization with occasional pseudopterygium has been noted. Under&#173;lying chronic ocular surface inflammation is absent.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> For mild cases, treatment is topical lubrication. Manual superficial keratectomy may be indicated in more severe cases associated with decreased vision due to irregular astigmatism, photophobia, and/or irritation. The simplicity of the surgical procedure used depends on the ability to find the correct corneal tissue plane. Once this plane is discovered by &#173;gently scraping with a rounded microsurgical Tooke blade, the nodule can be peeled off with a jeweler’s forceps (Fig&#160;6-14C, <span class="h5-text_xref-video">Video&#160;6-2</span>). This degeneration may recur. PTK has also been used to treat this condition but may result in an irregular corneal contour or an undesirable refractive outcome.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal arcus is usually an involutional change that is modified by ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors and caused by the deposition of lipid in the peripheral corneal stroma. The lipid is concentrated at 2 levels: (1) adjacent to Bowman layer and (2) near Descemet membrane. A relatively clear zone is pre&#173;sent between the peripheral edge of the arcus and the limbus &#173;because Bowman layer does not reach the limbus, and the insertion of Descemet membrane is at Schwalbe line. The arcus has a hazy white appearance, a sharp outer border, and an indistinct central border; it is denser superiorly and inferiorly (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-15">Fig&#160;6-15</span>). The arcus starts at the inferior and superior aspects of the cornea and ultimately involves the entire circumference.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The prevalence of corneal arcus is increased in African American individuals and in males; it also increases with age. Most patients older than 80&#160;years have corneal arcus. Corneal arcus may also occur as a congenital anomaly <span class="italic">(arcus juvenilis).</span> <span class="keypoint_underline">In patients youn&#173;ger than 40&#160;years, the presence of arcus may be indicative of hyperlipoproteinemia with an elevated serum cholesterol level.

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Crocodile shagreen, or <span class="italic">mosaic degeneration,</span> is a bilateral corneal opacity with a characteristic mosaic pattern reminiscent of a crocodile’s back. It consists of centrally located, polygonal gray opacities at the level of Bowman layer that are separated by clear zones. On histologic examination, Bowman layer is indented, forming ridges, and it may be calcified. Similar changes can occur in the deep stroma, near Descemet membrane, or in the corneal periphery. The condition is usually not visually significant.</p>
					<p class="h3">Polymorphic amyloid degeneration</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polymorphic amyloid degeneration is a bilateral symmetric, primarily central, and slowly progressive corneal degeneration that appears &#173;later in life and is characterized by amyloid deposition. The crystalline deposits in this disorder can resemble the amyloid deposits in early lattice corneal dystrophy, but they are found primarily in the mid to deep stroma and histologically may appear to indent Descemet membrane. The opacities can appear gray-&#173;white, somewhat refractile, and crystalline in retroillumination (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-16">Fig&#160;6-16</span>). The intervening stroma appears clear, and &#173;unless the condition is advanced, vision is usually minimally affected. Recurrent erosions do not occur, and cataract surgery can be performed without added risk. See Chapters&#160;8 and 10 for more information on amyloid in the cornea.</p>
					<p class="h3">Furrow degeneration</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Furrow degeneration is seen in older adults and is characterized by corneal arcus (discussed &#173;earlier) associated with peripheral thinning within the clear zone. The corneal epithelium remains intact, and &#173;there is no associated inflammation, vascularization, or potential for perforation. Vision is rarely affected, and no treatment is required. Although the thinning is generally slight, it can appear more prominent. For cases in which circumlimbal involvement eventually occurs, the cataract surgeon may consider using a scleral rather than clear corneal approach.</p>
					<p class="h3">Terrien marginal degeneration</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Terrien marginal degeneration (TMD) is a slowly progressive thinning disorder of the peripheral corneal stroma. It is usually bilateral but may be asymmetric. TMD is typically a painless condition but may be associated with inflammation. Although individuals of any age can be affected, TMD appears primarily in patients older than 40&#160;years. Males are affected more frequently than females. The cause of this condition is unknown. The thinning typically pre&#173;sents superiorly but may spread circumferentially. It usually does not pro&#173;gress &#173;toward the central cornea but may involve the inferior limbus. Affected patients often are asymptomatic &#173;until both&#173;ered by blurred vision due to induced astigmatism.</p>

In <span class="italic">secondary lipid keratopathy</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 6-18">Fig&#160;6-18</span>), yellow or cream-&#173;colored lipids containing cholesterol, neutral fats, and glycoproteins are deposited in the superficial or deep stroma following corneal inflammation with vascularization (eg, as occurs in chemical injury or interstitial keratitis related to herpes keratitis or syphilis). In rare instances, lipid keratopathy has been reported with no evidence of an antecedent infection, inflammatory &#173;process, or corneal damage; such cases are described as <span class="italic">primary lipid keratopathy.</span> Occasionally, lipid keratopathy can be associated with focal stromal necrosis in the absence of significant inflammation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Treatment is indicated in cases of decreased vision or compromised cosmetic appearance. Controlling the neovascularization with topical corticosteroids may reduce or even stop the progression of the keratopathy. Green &#173;laser treatment in the presence of a few isolated vessels, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, cautery, and subconjunctival and topical bevacizumab have been reported to reduce corneal neovascularization and lipid deposition; however, the effects may be short-&#173;lived, and the effectiveness of &#173;these modalities is unclear. Recently, cannulization with embolization of the vessels has been described. Mitomycin intravascular chemoembolization (MICE) involves injecting mitomycin C into an afferent vessel to occlude it, destroy existing vessels, and prevent intrastromal neovascularization.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The first variant, iris nevus syndrome <span class="h5-text_italic">(Cogan-&#173;Reese syndrome),</span> is characterized by the presence of multiple pedunculated or diffusely pigmented iris nodules, which are produced by the contracting endothelial membrane (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 6-19">Fig&#160;6-19</span>).

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis of ICE syndrome is unknown but appears to involve abnormal proliferation of endothelial cells that have acquired the ultrastructural characteristics of epithelial cells (ICE cells). It is not clear when the abnormal cloning occurs; however, a viral etiology (herpesvirus) for ICE syndrome has been postulated, as viral DNA has been identified in some specimens following keratoplasty and in the aqueous of some patients with ICE syndrome. ICE cells seen with specular microscopy (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 6-21">Fig&#160;6-21</span>) are typically abnormal, large, rounded, and pleomorphic. They show a characteristic reversal of the normal “light–&#173;dark” pattern; thus, the surface appears dark with an occasional central light spot, and the intercellular borders appear light. In vivo confocal microscopy shows ICE cells to be pleomorphic epithelial-&#173;like endothelial cells with hyperreflective nuclei and cell borders that appear brighter than cell surfaces. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is useful for detecting changes in &#173;angle structures in ICE syndrome, especially when corneal edema does not allow visualization with gonioscopy.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Endothelial keratoplasty is the preferred treatment of the corneal component of this syndrome &#173;unless &#173;there is significant corneal scarring, in which case penetrating keratoplasty might be more appropriate. Long-&#173;term graft clarity depends on the successful control of intraocular pressure, which can be difficult (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="h5-text_italic">Glaucoma</span>). Medical treatment of the glaucoma can be challenging. If filtering surgery is performed, the progressive growth of the abnormal endothelial membrane can block the filtration site. Tube shunt surgery may be more successful.</p>

They result from thickening of Descemet membrane, which takes place throughout life, and are seen on the posterior corneal surface, protruding &#173;toward the anterior chamber. At the slit lamp, Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies appear as small, dark dimples within the endothelial mosaic. &#173;These are best seen with specular reflection. Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies are found in patients youn&#173;ger than 20&#160;years only in rare instances; they increase steadily in number with age.

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmic glaucoma medi&#173;cations containing netarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, can also cause cornea verticillata. See <span class="xref-table" id="Table 6-6">&#173;Table&#160;6-6</span> for a comprehensive list of systemic drugs associated with cornea verticillata.</p>
					<p class="body-text">It is unusual for &#173;these deposits to cause reduced vision or ocular symptoms, although this has occurred in some patients. The deposits typically clear with discontinuation of the medi&#173;cation. Reduced vision associated with the use of amiodarone or tamoxifen prompts consideration of the possibility of optic neuropathy. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity associated with the use of drugs belonging to the aminoquinoline &#173;family can also reduce vision (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">&#173;Retina and Vitreous,</span> for discussion of ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of cornea verticillata includes Fabry disease, a disorder of sphingolipid metabolism. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span> for a discussion of corneal deposits associated with systemic disease.</p>
					<p class="h2">Other Drug-&#173;Induced Corneal Deposits and Toxicities</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other drugs that can cause corneal deposits and toxicity include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Amantadine,</span> used to treat dyskinesia, can cause bilateral corneal edema and reduced endothelial cell counts.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Therapy with topical ciprofloxacin</span> (and, less often, other fluoroquinolones) can result in the deposition of a chalky white precipitate composed of ciprofloxacin crystals within an epithelial defect (<span class="bullet-list_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 6-25">Fig&#160;6-25</span>). Although white plaques predominate, a crystalline pattern may also be seen. The deposits resolve &#173;after the medi&#173;cation is discontinued.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Chlorhexidine gluconate,</span> a solution commonly used for surgical site preparation, can lead to corneal abrasions, stromal edema, and endothelial decompensation.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Chlorpromazine,</span> a member of the phenothiazine &#173;family, is an antipsychotic that may cause corneal deposition of pigment in up to one-&#173;third of patients receiving long-&#173;term chlorpromazine therapy. The drug prob&#173;ably enters the cornea through the aqueous; thus, the brown opacities are first found in the posterior stroma, Descemet membrane, and endothelium. The drug &#173;later spreads to the anterior stroma and epithelium. Chlorpromazine can also cause deposits on the anterior lens capsule.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Isotretinoin,</span> a vitamin A derivative used to treat acne, is typically associated with fine, diffuse gray deposits in the central and peripheral cornea.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Gold salts</span> can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. With long-&#173;term use and cumulative doses exceeding 1&#160;g, posterior stromal deposits that spare Descemet membrane and the endothelium develop in a high percentage of patients.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Rifabutin,</span> an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis and to prevent and treat <span class="bullet-list_italic">Mycobacterium avium</span> complex, has been described as causing stellate, refractile corneal endothelial deposits. &#173;These appear initially in the periphery but over time can extend to the central cornea.</li>
					</ul>
