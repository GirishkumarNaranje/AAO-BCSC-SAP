			<p class="h1">Examination of the External Eye</p>
				<div  id="Chapt2_Top1">
					<p class="h2-h1">General Appearance</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The external eye examination begins with observing the patient upon entering the exam room. The patient’s general appearance, body habitus, physical difficulties, personal hygiene, and ease of interaction provide the clinician with valuable information that aids in establishing rapport, determining examination challenges, developing a differential diagnosis, and preparing a treatment plan. The condition of the patient’s skin, including the presence and distribution of rashes or lesions, signs of acne rosacea, malar rash, eczema, and the degree of pigmentation can provide clues to diagnosis. The presence of swollen joints or ulnar deviation of the fin&#173;gers may raise the question of inflammatory arthritis. External eye conditions, such as proptosis, enophthalmos, malposition, asymmetry, diminished retropulsion, and orbital rim step-&#173;off, can also guide the clinician &#173;toward diagnosis and a plan for treatment.</p>
					<p class="h2">The Eyelids</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Assessment of the eyelid surface is recommended to identify signs of inflammation, eyelid lesions, and eyelash abnormalities such as madarosis or trichiasis. Eyelid position should also be evaluated with par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar attention to eyelid retraction, lagophthalmos, scleral show, ptosis, entropion, and ectropion. Evaluation of the frequency and completeness of blinking as well as eyelid laxity may yield crucial information about eyelid function. The eyelid can routinely be everted to identify conditions contributing to ocular surface disease, such as cicatrizing conjunctivitis, papillary conjunctivitis, or foreign bodies.</p>
					<p class="h2">Corneal Sensation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal sensory nerves are derived primarily from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). Corneal sensation is generally classified as normal, reduced, or absent. Corneal sensation and the blink response can be assessed by means of a wisp of cotton from a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator in the absence of topical anesthesia and before &#173;measuring intraocular pressure. Approaching the patient from the side helps avoid a reflexive flinch from the patient during this procedure. Of note, the cotton swab can disturb the corneal surface; therefore, it is impor&#173;tant to evaluate the cornea prior to checking sensation.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>An evaluation of corneal sensation with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator is recommended in patients with suspected neurotrophic disease, particularly in the presence of exposure.</p>
					<p class="h3">Handheld esthesiometer</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Quantitative methods for &#173;measuring corneal sensation typically are reserved for research or complex cases. The most common quantitative device is the Cochet-&#173;Bonnet esthesiometer, a handheld device containing a thin, retractable nylon monofilament (Video&#160;2-1). The monofilament, extended to its full length, is placed on the patient’s cornea. If the patient cannot feel the filament, it is retracted incrementally and brought to the patient’s cornea until it is felt. The pressure applied by the device is a function of the length of this monofilament. As the length decreases from 60&#160;mm to 5&#160;mm, the pressure increases from 11&#160;mm/g to a maximum of 200&#160;mm/g.</p>

					<p class="body-text">The slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope has 2 rotating arms—1 for the slit illuminator and 1 for the biomicroscope—&#173;mounted on a common axis. The illumination unit is essentially a light projector with a beam that is adjustable in width, height, direction, intensity, and color. On examination, reflections of light are vis&#173;i&#173;ble from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea and lens; &#173;these are known as <span class="italic">Purkinje images</span> or <span class="italic">reflexes</span>. The magnification power of the biomicroscope is adjustable, and the illumination and microscope arms are parfocal, arranged so that both focus onto the same spot, with the slit beam centered on the field of view. This setup accommodates vari&#173;ous forms of illumination.</p>

					</p>
					
					<p class="h2">Illumination Techniques</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At the slit lamp, the target can be illuminated directly or indirectly (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-1">Fig&#160;2-1</span>).</p>
					<p class="h3">Direct illumination</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Direct illumination techniques include diffuse, focal, and specular illumination.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diffuse illumination</span> In diffuse illumination, the light beam is broadened, reduced in intensity, and directed obliquely at the eye. By swinging the illuminator arm to produce highlights and shadows, the visibility of irregularities of the ocular surface (eg, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy) and iris lesions can be improved.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Focal illumination</span> In focal illumination, the light beam and the microscope are directed to the same spot, and the slit aperture is narrowed. Focal illumination is achieved with a broad beam or a slit beam:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">Broad-&#173;beam illumination, which uses a beam width of about 3&#160;mm, is optimal for visualizing eyelid lesions and opacities associated with corneal dystrophies or scarring.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Slit-&#173;beam illumination, which uses a beam width of about 1&#160;mm or less, yields an optical section of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-2">Fig&#160;2-2</span>) for evaluation of corneal thinning, edema, stromal infiltrates, and endothelial abnormalities. Reducing the height of the beam facilitates assessment of cell and flare in the anterior chamber. For information on cell and flare grading, see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="bullet-list_italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="body-text">
						<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="BCSC2025-26_S08_C02_p017_042_4P-web-resources/image/StepstoView.png" alt="" />
					</p>
					
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Specular reflection</span> Another direct illumination technique is based on <span class="h4-text_italic">specular reflection,</span> which is a normal light reflex from the corneal surfaces (see Fig&#160;2-1D). A faint reflection comes from the posterior corneal surface. Specular reflection improves visualization of the corneal endothelium. At the higher magnification power of 40<span class="h4-text_symbol">×</span>, cell density and morphology are more clearly vis&#173;i&#173;ble (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-3">Fig&#160;2-3</span>); guttae and keratic precipitates appear as nonreflective dark areas.</p>
					<p class="h3">Indirect illumination</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For indirect illumination, the slit beam is shined on the iris or is used to create a red reflex in order to backlight the cornea. &#173;There are 3 types of indirect illumination: proximal illumination, sclerotic scatter, and retroillumination.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Proximal illumination</span> In proximal illumination, the knob on the illumination arm is turned slightly, decentering the light beam from its isocentric position and causing the light beam and the microscope to be focused on adjacent spots. When the cornea adjacent to the illuminated area is being examined, the same technique can be used without decentering the light beam. By taking advantage of the opacity of deep tissue layers, this method enables visualization of small irregularities with a refractive index similar to that of the surroundings. By slightly oscillating the light beam, small 3-&#173;dimensional lesions, such as corneal foreign bodies, can be detected.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Sclerotic scatter</span> Total internal reflection in the cornea makes <span class="h4-text_italic">sclerotic scatter</span> pos&#173;si&#173;ble. (See BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="h4-text_italic">Clinical Optics and Vision Rehabilitation,</span> for a discussion of total internal reflection.) When the isocentric light beam is decentered, an intense beam is shined on the limbus and scatters off the sclera, causing the cornea to glow faintly (see Fig&#160;2-1C). Reflective opacities stand out against the dark field, whereas areas of reduced light transmission in the cornea appear as shades of gray. This technique enables identification of epithelial edema, mild stromal infiltration, nebulae, and cornea verticillata.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Retroillumination</span> Retroillumination can be used to examine more than 1 area of the eye. <span class="keypoint_underline">Crystalline opacities, neovascularization, fingerprint lines, and transillumination of iris defects are best appreciated with this technique.</span> Retroillumination from the iris is achieved by displacing the beam tangentially while examining the cornea. In the zone between light and dark backgrounds, the visibility of subtle corneal abnormalities is enhanced. Retroillumination from the fundus is performed by aligning the light beam nearly parallel with the examiner’s visual axis and rotating the light so that, ideally, it shines through the edge of a dilated pupil (see Fig&#160;2-1B). Corneal surface irregularities (see <span class="h4-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>, Figs&#160;8-1B and 8-4A) and other corneal opacities, cornea guttae (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-4">Fig&#160;2-4</span>), other changes at the level of Descemet membrane, phakic and pseudophakic lenses, and a posterior capsule are readily vis&#173;i&#173;ble against the red reflex.</p>

					<p class="h2">Clinical Use</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Direct illumination of the eyelid structures (eyelashes, margin, and meibomian glands), the conjunctiva, and the sclera is recommended as the first step of the slit-&#173;lamp examination, with a broad beam applied to illuminate the cornea and overlying tear film in the optical section. Having the patient blink can help the examiner distinguish corneal pathology from debris in the tear film. &#173;After the initial low-&#173;power screening, much of the examination is performed at higher magnification, and details are examined with a narrow beam. The height of the tear meniscus and discrete lesions in the cornea can be examined with the slit-&#173;beam micrometer or an eyepiece reticule. The slit beam is then used to estimate the corneal thickness and anterior chamber depth. Early signs of corneal edema on slit-&#173;lamp examination include patchy or diffuse haze within the epithelium, mild stromal thickening, faint but deep stromal wrinkles, and folds in Descemet membrane accompanied by patchy posterior stromal haze.</p>

			<p class="h1">Ocular Surface Staining and Evaluation of Tear Function</p>
				<div  id="Chapt2_Top3">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Special testing modalities for evaluation of the external eye and cornea include ocular surface staining by means of fluorescein, lissamine green, or &#173;rose bengal and assessment of tear production and the tear film with Schirmer testing, commercially available microassays, or meibography.</p>
					<p class="reference-first">Kim&#160;J. The use of vital dyes in corneal disease. <span class="reference_italic">Curr Opin Ophthalmol.</span> 2000;11(4):241–247.</p>
					<p class="h2">Tear Film and Ocular Surface Staining</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Fluorescein</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fluorescein, a nontoxic, water-&#173;soluble, synthetic dye, is a &#173;popular choice for ocular surface staining. Fluorescein is used to help assess both the tear film and the cornea. When fluorescein is added without excess saline, the tear film may be examined. In patients with corneal thinning, fluorescein may pool in areas where tears collect. In areas where the cornea is raised, the precorneal tear film may also be thinner or absent. As a result, the raised area &#173;will appear dark in contrast to the fluorescein-&#173;filled tear film at the base of the elevated area, as in epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>, Fig&#160;8-4B). Fluorescein also “stains” or binds to areas of intercellular junction disruption and epithelial loss and manifests as punctate erosions, macroerosions, and ulcerative epithelial defects. &#173;These areas of uptake &#173;will remain stained &#173;after fluorescein has been cleared from the tear film. &#173;Because certain disease states produce characteristic punctate staining patterns, &#173;these areas of uptake may facilitate diagnosis and treatment (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-5">Fig&#160;2-5</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">When fluorescein collects in an epithelial defect, it diffuses into the corneal stroma and anterior chamber, yielding a green flare. For this reason, it is impor&#173;tant to check the anterior chamber for flare before instilling fluorescein and to evaluate the fluorescein stain shortly &#173;after instillation. In contrast, in the presence of corneal edema, an epithelial defect may not stain as intensely. In addition, fluorescein may obscure corneal opacities, which may be better appreciated prior to instillation of the dye.</p>
					<p class="body-text">For examination of the ocular surface, topical fluorescein is available as a nonpreserved 2% unit-&#173;dose eyedrop or a moistened impregnated paper strip designed to transfer the dye to the tear film. Once stained, the ocular surface is examined at the slit lamp with a cobalt blue filter, although a yellow filter may improve observation. Vari&#173;ous grading systems can then be used to assess the level or degree of staining (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-6">Fig&#160;2-6</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Preserved fluorescein formulations combined with anesthetic are also available, primarily for applanation tonometry.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Care should be taken to avoid misclassifying an area containing pooled dye (eg, in an indentation or thinning of the cornea) as an epithelial defect. To absorb pooled dye, the eye can be anesthetized and a wisp of cotton can be applied to the area. If the epithelium is intact, the dye &#173;will be removed, with no staining noted at the base. Alternatively, an area of pooling can be revealed by irrigating the fluorescein from the tear film.</p>
					<p class="h3">Other diagnostic tests using fluorescein</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">tear breakup time (TBUT)</span> test is performed by instilling fluorescein and asking the patient to hold the eyelids open &#173;after 1 or 2 blinks; the tear film is then evaluated using a broad slit beam with cobalt blue illumination. The number of seconds &#173;until a dry spot appears in the tear film is the TBUT. The appearance of dry spots in less than 10 seconds is considered an abnormal result. It is impor&#173;tant to &#173;measure TBUT before any manipulation of the eyelids or instillation of other drops. Fluorescein-&#173;anesthetic combination drops are not recommended for this purpose &#173;because excessive fluorescein is typically instilled, and the anesthetic may affect the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">dye disappearance test</span> assesses the clearance of tears. Fluorescein is applied, and the tear meniscus is observed. Per&#173;sis&#173;tence of the dye suggests that the tear drainage system is blocked. The <span class="italic">Seidel test</span> is performed to detect leakage of aqueous humor through a corneal perforation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-7">Fig&#160;2-7</span>) or a leaking trabeculectomy bleb (Video&#160;2-3). Fluorescein is instilled at the site of suspected leakage using a moistened strip or concentrated drop, and the presence or absence of clear fluid flowing through the orange dye is determined with cobalt blue light. <span class="keypoint_underline">In a leaking eye, Seidel test results may be falsely negative or intermittent when the eye is hypotonous.</span></p>

					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Lissamine green and &#173;rose bengal</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lissamine green and &#173;rose bengal (both available as a 1% solution or in impregnated strips) are water-&#173;soluble dyes that stain devitalized epithelial cells. The lack of mucin in the precorneal tear film in a diseased state also allows for uptake of &#173;these dyes. As a result, &#173;these dyes are routinely used for evaluating tear-&#173;deficient states and for detecting and assessing vari&#173;ous epithelial lesions, such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-8">Fig&#160;2-8</span>). &#173;Rose bengal is toxic to the epithelium and commonly &#173;causes irritation upon instillation. Lissamine green, which has few toxic effects in cultured &#173;human corneal epithelial cells, is better tolerated and is also useful for assessing conjunctival abnormalities.</p>
					<p class="h2">Evaluation of Tear Production</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Assessment with Schirmer strips</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tear production can be assessed with Schirmer strips, which are thin strips of filter paper (5&#160;mm wide, 30&#160;mm long) (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 2-1">&#173;Table&#160;2-1</span>). &#173;These strips are placed at the junction of the &#173;middle and lateral thirds of the lower eyelid, with 5&#160;mm of the paper length folded over the eyelid margin posteriorly and the remaining 25&#160;mm projecting anteriorly to the lower-&#173;eyelid margin. Tear production is &#173;measured by the length in millimeters that the strip wets during the test. The test can be performed with the eyes open or closed. Although vari&#173;ous authorities label tests differently, 3 categories are generally recognized: basic secretion, Schirmer&#160;I, and Schirmer II tests.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">basic secretion test</span> &#173;measures basal tear secretion and is performed &#173;after instillation of a topical anesthetic and blotting of residual fluid from the inferior fornix. Although variations in tear secretion are normal, repeated &#173;measurements of less than 5&#160;mm of wetting &#173;after 5 minutes are highly suggestive of aqueous tear deficiency (ATD; discussed in Chapter&#160;3).</p>

The glandular structure may be evaluated at the slit lamp by transilluminating the everted eyelid with an external light source such as a Finoff transilluminator. Infrared meibography provides visualization and aids in a quantitative analy&#173;sis of any gland loss (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-9">Fig&#160;2-9</span>). Interferometry enables precise quantification of the height of the tear film meniscus and &#173;measurement of the thickness and structure of the lipid layer with submicrometer accuracy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-10">Fig&#160;2-10</span>).

					<p class="h2">Keratoscopy</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratoscopy is a qualitative evaluation of the anterior cornea in which the reflections of illuminated concentric rings projected onto the corneal surface are observed for the shape and quality of the rings and the distance between them. A keratoscope usually has multiple concentric rings that are projected onto the cornea using ambient, external, or intrinsic light sources (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-11">Fig&#160;2-11A</span>). &#173;These projections, or <span class="italic">mires,</span> appear closer together in the steeper part of the cornea, and the short axis depicts the steeper meridian. Along the flat (long) axis, the mires appear farther apart (Fig&#160;2-11B, C). This information can be helpful for detection of paracentral and peripheral disorders of corneal contour, such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and astigmatism &#173;after penetrating keratoplasty. Although handheld keratoscopes are no longer widely available, the information obtained with their use can be gleaned from any device that proj&#173;ects keratoscopic rings (also known as a <span class="italic">Placido disk</span>).</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Keratoscopy is helpful for detecting corneal surface irregularities in and around the visual axis. Although keratoscopes are no longer widely available, &#173;these irregularities can also be revealed by the mires of a keratometer or any device that utilizes the Placido disk (see <span class="sidebar-text--no-indent-_clinic_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>, Fig&#160;8-4C).</p>
					<p class="h2">Keratometry</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The keratometer is used to approximate the cornea’s refracting power by quantitatively determining the curvature of the central anterior corneal surface. It does this by &#173;measuring the image size of a reflected mire in each of the principal meridians. The most common types of manual keratometers are the Helmholtz type and the Javal-&#173;Schi<span class="accent">ø</span>tz type (discussed in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics and Vision Rehabilitation</span>). The Helmholtz keratometer is a 1-&#173;position device with adjustable image size. The examiner aligns “plus sign” mires (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-12">Fig&#160;2-12</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The manual keratometer has certain limitations. It allows visualization of only a 4-mm region of the cornea at a time; patients must alter their gaze in order for other areas to be seen. Keratometry is based on the assumption that the cornea has a symmetric spherocylindrical shape with major and minor axes separated by 90°; it does not account for &#173;spherical aberrations, and it is susceptible to focusing and misalignment errors. If the cornea is irregular, distortion of the mires reduces the accuracy of the &#173;measurement. Despite &#173;these drawbacks, the manual keratometer does allow accurate &#173;measurement of central-&#173;anterior corneal astigmatism. Clinicians can also use the keratometer dynamically by comparing &#173;measurements in primary gaze with &#173;those in upgaze. Steepening of the inferior cornea is an early sign of keratoconus. Newer technology is supplanting the keratometer for contact lens fitting, corneal refractive surgical planning, and IOL se&#173;lection (see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;11</span>, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract</span>).</p>

					<p class="h2">Corneal Topography</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography is a noninvasive imaging modality for mapping the curvature of the corneal surface. Placido disk–&#173;based corneal topography involves the projection of keratoscopic rings (ie, mires) onto the cornea. Irregularities of the mires signify irregularities of the corneal surface, which can be associated with vision loss.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The keratoscopic images reflected from the corneal surface are digitally captured and analyzed by computer. Computerized topography systems allow analyses of pupil size and location, regular and irregular astigmatism, keratoconus risk, simulated corneal curvature &#173;measurements, wavefront analy&#173;sis, dry eye screening, meibomian gland imagery, and &#173;angle kappa. &#173;Measurements are made at thousands of points, and color-&#173;coded <span class="italic">power maps</span> are generated from &#173;these data. <span class="keypoint_accent_underline">Notably, &#173;these devices can assess only the anterior corneal surface and tear film.</span></p>

					<p class="body-text">Although topographers provide numerous outputs through analytics, &#173;there are 2 primary types of anterior power maps:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">An <span class="bullet-list_italic">axial map</span> is calculated with the assumption that light rays are refracted to a focal point along a central axis. This calculation method for topography yields a map that depicts the overall curvature rather than focal irregularities; thus, &#173;there is a “smoothing” of the curvature. Although the central 1<span class="bullet-list_figuredash">‒</span>2&#160;mm are not imaged well &#173;because of the reflective nature of the &#173;measurements obtained, axial maps depict a more accurate view of the refractive characteristics of the central cornea while poorly representing the peripheral cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-13">Fig&#160;2-13</span>).</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">A <span class="bullet-list_italic">tangential map</span> is calculated by considering only the focal curvature of the cornea, resulting in less smoothing of the curvature than seen on the axial map (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-14">Fig&#160;2-14</span>). However, the resulting image has greater sensitivity for focal changes in corneal curvature and better depicts peripheral changes. (In &#173;these maps, diopters are relative units of curvature and do not equal diopters of corneal power.)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Before any topographic maps are interpreted, the Placido disk images should be checked for centration and image quality. The color scale must be reviewed to determine the type of map being studied. The scale can dramatically influence the interpretation of the map.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-4"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>In corneal topography, smaller increments of the color scale increase sensitivity but exaggerate small changes, whereas larger increments decrease sensitivity and can mask meaningful variations.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The absolute scale is constant for all examinations and is useful for comparisons over time and among patients. The normalized, or relative, scale adjusts to the range of powers on the corneal surface and differs for each cornea. Thus, the power range and step size may be narrow or broad. In addition to the limitations of the algorithms, the accuracy of corneal topography mapping is susceptible to the following issues:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">misalignment</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;limited stability (test-&#173;to-&#173;test variation)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">focus errors</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">tear film effects</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">distortions</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;limited coverage area (central and limbal)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">lack of standardized data maps</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">colors that may be absolute or varied (normalized)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Nevertheless, corneal topography maps allow clinicians to detect keratoconus early, identify subclinical and frank keratoconus during refractive surgery screenings, and recognize and predict corneal ectasia &#173;after refractive surgery. (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span> for discussion of keratoconus and corneal ectasia.) Corneal mapping is also useful in managing congenital and postoperative astigmatism, particularly following penetrating keratoplasty, and in monitoring pterygia, scarring, and degenerative changes in the cornea such as epithelial basement membrane dystrophy or Salzman nodular degeneration. Complex peripheral corneal pathology may result in an axis of astigmatism in spectacles that is not aligned with the axis of the power map.</p>
					<p class="h2">Corneal Tomography</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">While topography relies on reflective properties of the anterior cornea and tear film, tomography systems obtain a series of images of the cornea, allowing the generation of a 3-&#173;dimensional reconstruction of the entire cornea. The device software analyzes &#173;these images to identify the anterior and posterior bound&#173;aries of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-15">Fig&#160;2-15</span>). In addition, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, and topography-&#173;like corneal curvature can be calculated from &#173;these images, and data on the iris and lens can be provided.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Tomography also produces elevation maps, which are calculated using a reference sphere, also called a <span class="italic">best-&#173;fit sphere</span> (a computer-&#173;generated sphere providing the best &#173;spherical approximation of the corneal shape). The maps indicate areas of the patient’s anterior and posterior cornea that are elevated or depressed relative to corresponding areas of their best-&#173;fit spheres (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-16">Fig&#160;2-16</span>). Mathematically, the calculation to determine the best-&#173;fit sphere radius for a corneal contour is analogous to a linear regression for a scatter plot in 2 dimensions. The elevation maps are a graphical repre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of the difference in position between this reference sphere and the &#173;actual data from the patient’s corneal images.</p>

					<p class="h2-h1">Confocal Microscopy</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Confocal microscopy is a noninvasive technique for in vivo imaging of the cornea. The basic princi&#173;ple of confocal microscopy is that a tissue site can be illuminated by a point source of light or &#173;laser and si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously imaged by a camera in the same plane (ie, confocal). This technique involves scanning a small region of tissue with thousands of spots of light, producing a high-&#173;resolution image at a cellular level. Tandem scanning, scanning-&#173;slit, and &#173;laser scanning confocal microscopes are &#173;popular options for clinical use. &#173;Laser scanning confocal systems can penetrate nontransparent tissues to generate a series of images from extremely thin sections. The depth of focus is 5<span class="figuredash">‒</span>7&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m in &#173;laser scanning, 7<span class="figuredash">‒</span>9&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m in tandem scanning, and 26&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m in scanning-&#173;slit microscopes.

					<p class="h2">Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior segment OCT is a noninvasive technology that produces 2-&#173;dimensional, high-&#173;resolution, high-&#173;definition cross-&#173;sectional images. AS-&#173;OCT images are similar to ultrasonographic images but are based on the emission and reflection of light (low-&#173;coherence interferometry). The achievable resolution (5–10&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m) allows exquisite delineation of the layers of the cornea, the anterior chamber, and the iris. The primary types of AS-&#173;OCT are time-&#173;domain (TD-&#173;OCT) and frequency-&#173;domain (FD-&#173;OCT). A subtype of FD-&#173;OCT is spectral-&#173;domain OCT (SD-&#173;OCT). Swept-&#173;source OCT (SS-&#173;OCT) combines ele&#173;ments of TD-&#173;OCT and SD-&#173;OCT. The device has been used in the office and the operating room (with the device mounted to an operating microscope) to facilitate endothelial keratoplasty and epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane peeling.</p>
					<p class="body-text">AS-&#173;OCT enables &#173;measurement of the depth, width, and &#173;angle of the anterior chamber as well as corneal thickness. In postoperative follow-up of endothelial keratoplasty cases, the shape, thickness, and attachment of donor tissue can be visualized and quantified with AS-&#173;OCT. This may be especially helpful when edema limits assessment at the slit lamp, as OCT is better able to penetrate moderate opacification. In LASIK cases, the caliper feature may be applied to &#173;measure corneal flap thickness and residual stromal bed thickness, which are both &#173;factors used in determining patient eligibility for an enhancement/re-&#173;treatment. Additional software is available to assess corneal curvature and epithelial thickness in patients considering refractive surgery and in determining true corneal power for IOL power calculation &#173;after LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">AS-&#173;OCT can be used to &#173;measure corneal epithelial thickness as a means of detecting keratoconus, indicated by the finding of thinned epithelium at the apex of the cone. It can also be used to detect increased thickening of the epithelium over a lesion, suggestive of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 2-20">Fig&#160;2-20</span>).</p>

UBM is applicable to many tissues, including the cornea, the anterior and posterior surfaces of the iris, the ciliary body, zonular fibers, &#173;angle structures, and the anterior lens capsule. UBM technology incorporates 25-&#173; to 100-&#173;MHz transducers into a B-&#173;mode clinical scanner, allowing higher resolution of anterior segment structures with less penetration than a traditional B-&#173;scan. <span class="keypoint_underline">Unlike AS-&#173;OCT, UBM allows the examiner to view structures through an opaque cornea and total hyphema.</span> The scleral spur, located where the trabecular meshwork meets an interface line between the sclera and ciliary body, is a valuable landmark for examining vari&#173;ous &#173;angle configurations.</p>
