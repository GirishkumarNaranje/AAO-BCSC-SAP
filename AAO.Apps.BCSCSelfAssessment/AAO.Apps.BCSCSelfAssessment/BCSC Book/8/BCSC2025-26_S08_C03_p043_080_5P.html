				<div  id="Chapt3_Top1">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter introduces the common clinical findings of the external eye and cornea that are found in vari&#173;ous ocular surface diseases (OSDs) and defines the terms used for &#173;these findings (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-1">&#173;Table&#160;3-1</span>). The chapter then focuses on the evaluation and management of dry eye and blepharitis, which are often key contributors to OSD.</p>
					<p class="h2">Conjunctival Signs of Inflammation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-2">&#173;Table&#160;3-2</span> lists conjunctival findings and ocular and systemic conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of inflammation of the conjunctiva. For the findings listed in the &#173;table, the sources of inflammation include toxic, autoimmune, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies. Two impor&#173;tant signs of conjunctival inflammation, papillae and follicles, are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
					<p class="h3">Papillae</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Papillae are localized, elevated conjunctival lesions consisting of a vascular core surrounded by connective tissue septa that anchor the palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva to the tarsus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-1">Fig&#160;3-1</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">An acute, mild papillary reaction produces a smooth, velvety appearance (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-2">Fig&#160;3-2A</span>). Chronic changes result in enlarged vascular tufts that appear as elevated, polygonal, hyperemic mounds (Fig&#160;3-2B). Each papilla has a central red dot that represents a dilated capillary core viewed end-on.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Prolonged, recurrent, or severe conjunctival inflammation &#173;causes the anchoring fibers of the palpebral conjunctiva to stretch and weaken, leading to confluent papillary hypertrophy. <span class="italic">&#173;Giant papillae</span> are defined as papillae with a dia&#173;meter greater than 0.3&#160;mm (Fig&#160;3-2C). Furrows between &#173;these enlarged fibrovascular structures collect mucus and purulent material. Following treatment, a fibrotic subepithelial scar may be seen at the apex of former &#173;giant papillae (Fig&#160;3-2D).</p>
					<p class="h3">Follicles</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival lymphoid tissue is normally pre&#173;sent within the substantia propria except in neonates, who do not have vis&#173;i&#173;ble follicles. Conjunctival follicles are round or oval clusters of lymphocytes (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-3">Fig&#160;3-3</span>). Small follicles are often vis&#173;i&#173;ble in the lower fornix. Clusters of enlarged, noninflamed follicles are occasionally seen in the forniceal or inferior palpebral conjunctiva of &#173;children and adolescents, a condition known as <span class="italic">benign lymphoid folliculosis</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-4">Fig&#160;3-4</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Follicular conjunctivitis is characterized by the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">conjunctival hyperemia</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">presence of new or enlarged follicles (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-5">Fig&#160;3-5</span>)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">vessels that surround the raised surface of follicles but are not vis&#173;i&#173;ble within the follicle</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">follicles typically seen in the palpebral conjunctiva and, less often, on the bulbar or limbal conjunctiva</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Follicular conjunctivitis must be differentiated from cysts produced by tubular epithelial infoldings associated with chronic inflammation and lymphangiectasis. See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;4</span>, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for additional discussion of follicular conjunctivitis.</p>

					<p class="h2">Corneal Signs of Inflammation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-3">&#173;Table&#160;3-3</span> lists corneal findings and ocular conditions, to consider in the differential diagnosis of inflammation of the cornea.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The pattern of corneal inflammation, or <span class="italic">keratitis,</span> can be described by the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">distribution:</span> diffuse, focal, or multifocal</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">depth:</span> epithelial, subepithelial, anterior stromal, deep stromal, or endothelial</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">location:</span> central, paracentral, or peripheral</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">shape:</span> dendritic, disciform, or geographic</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h3">Epithelial inflammation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Punctate keratopathy</span> is a nonspecific term that encompasses a spectrum of biomicroscopic changes with varying degrees of associated inflammation; punctate epithelial erosions (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-6">Fig&#160;3-6A</span>) that stain with fluorescein; and punctate epithelial keratitis (Fig&#160;3-6B), which has raised epithelial areas and is associated with a relative lack of overlying tear film. &#173;These areas can be appreciated with fluorescein in the tear film. The apex of &#173;these punctate changes may stain with fluorescein, as seen in Thygeson epithelial keratitis. The lesions may have a “stuck on” appearance, as seen in herpes zoster keratitis (Fig&#160;3-6C).</p>
					<p class="h3">Stromal inflammation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammatory cells can enter the corneal stroma, resulting in stromal inflammation, in several ways: (a) from the tear film, through an epithelial defect and/or direct interlamellar infiltration at the limbus (eg, &#173;after &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis [LASIK]); (b) from the aqueous humor; or (c) in a vascularized cornea, directly from infiltrating blood and lymphatic vessels. Stromal inflammation can be <span class="italic">suppurative,</span> characterized by dense immune cell infiltration and often an overlying epithelial defect (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-7">Fig&#160;3-7</span>); or <span class="italic">nonsuppurative,</span> which pre&#173;sents with varying degrees of immune cell infiltration, neovascularization, and edema; the overlying epithelium may be intact.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Stromal inflammation can lead to opacification. Altered stromal keratocytes make new collagen fibers that are disor&#173;ga&#173;nized; scatter light; and cause scarring (sometimes referred to as “stromal haze”) that can incorporate calcium complexes, lipids, and proteinaceous material. Dark pigmentation of a residual corneal opacity is often a result of incorporated melanin or iron salts.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Stromal inflammation can also lead to neovascularization. Subepithelial fibrous tissue within the peripheral cornea is called <span class="italic">pannus</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-8">Fig&#160;3-8</span>). Neovascularization may occur in deeper levels of the cornea, depending on the nature and location of the inflammatory stimulus.</p>
					<p class="h3">Endothelial inflammation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endothelial inflammation results in dysfunction that can lead to reversible or irreversible endothelial decompensation, which can result in epithelial and stromal edema. Swollen endothelial cells called <span class="italic">inflammatory pseudoguttae</span> are vis&#173;i&#173;ble on specular reflection as dark areas of the normal endothelial mosaic pattern. <span class="italic">Keratic precipitates (KPs)</span> are clumps of inflammatory cells that adhere to the posterior surface of the cornea and come from extravasated white cells from the iris vasculature during the course of keratitis or uveitis. The clinical appearance of typical KPs depends on their composition:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">Fibrin and proteins coagulate into small dots and strands.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">Neutrophils and lymphocytes aggregate into punctate, round, or stellate opacities.</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">Macrophages coalesce into larger “mutton-&#173;fat” clumps.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">KPs and focal stromal edema are seen in disciform keratitis associated with herpes zoster and simplex, and in endothelial graft rejection (see Fig&#160;3-7B). An inflammatory plaque of fibrin and debris on the endothelium can be seen in eyes with fungal keratitis and may indicate spread of infection through Descemet membrane.</p>

				<div  id="Chapt3_Top2">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dry eye (also called <span class="italic">dry eye disease</span> or <span class="italic">syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca</span>) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film that is accompanied by ocular discomfort and/or blurred vision. <span class="keypoint_underline">Tear film instability and associated hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiologic roles in this disease.</span> Dry eye results from disturbance of the lacrimal functional unit, an integrated system comprising the lacrimal glands, cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelids, as well as the sensory and motor nerves connecting &#173;these components. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span> for a discussion of the lacrimal functional unit.</p>

					<p class="body-text">The prevalence of dry eye increases with age (10% of individuals aged 30–60&#160;years and 15% of adults older than 65&#160;years) and is higher among &#173;women.

					<p class="body-text">Dry eye is one of the most common reasons for ophthalmologic office visits. Patients may be highly symptomatic, and treatments rarely eliminate symptoms completely. Lifestyle modifications to reduce aggravating &#173;factors are often necessary. The challenges of dry eye can be a considerable source of psychological stress and can require substantial support. &#173;Organizations such as the Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren’s Foundation (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sjogrens.org">www.&#173;sjogrens.org</a>) provide valuable resources for affected individuals. Patients with symptoms that are out of proportion to their examination findings may also be diagnosed with ocular neuropathic pain, a diagnosis given when sensory nerve function seems aberrant. For certain patients, consultation with physicians specializing in pain management, neurology, or psychiatry can be very helpful.</p>

					<p class="h2">Mechanisms of Dry Eye</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As stated previously, dry eye is a multifactorial disease. Tear hyperosmolarity stresses the surface epithelium, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators that disrupt the junctions between the superficial epithelial cells. T cells can infiltrate the epithelium and produce pro-&#173;inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis &#173;factor <span class="greek">α</span> (TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span>) and interleukin 1 (IL-1). &#173;These cytokines promote accelerated detachment of the epithelial cells and apoptosis (programmed cell death), which results in further disruption of intercellular junctions and influx of inflammatory cells, creating a vicious cycle; this cycle is an impor&#173;tant &#173;factor in the etiology of dry eye (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-9">Fig&#160;3-9</span>).</p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Dry eye can be divided into 2 major forms: aqueous tear deficiency (ATD) and evaporative dry eye (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-10">Fig&#160;3-10</span>). Patients often have ele&#173;ments of both conditions.</span> In patients with ATD, also referred to as <span class="italic">keratoconjunctivitis sicca,</span> T-&#173;cell–&#173;mediated inflammation of the lacrimal gland occurs, leading to diminished tear production and propagation of inflammatory mediators on the ocular surface. In patients with evaporative dry eye, the primary abnormality is meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Multiple mechanisms can contribute to meibomian gland disease, including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">altered meibum lipid metabolism, which leads to gland obstruction</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">viscous and abnormal meibum, leading to low secretory rates</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">obstruction of the flow of meibum due to keratinization over the orifices or ductal epithelial hyperplasia due to noncicatricial conditions</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">obstruction of flow due to scarred duct orifices resulting from cicatricial disease states</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">meibomian gland loss and/or atrophy, leading to reduced production of meibum</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Abnormalities in meibum quality and/or quantity lead to tear film instability as well as tear evaporation and hyperosmolarity, initiating the inflammatory cycle. Tear film instability can also be initiated by other &#173;factors (see &#173;Table&#160;3-4). &#173;These include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">cigarette smoking</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">contact lens wear</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">environmental &#173;factors (eg, low ambient humidity or air drafts from a fan or air vent)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">a high ratio of dietary omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">long-&#173;term use of preserved topical ocular medi&#173;cations</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">ocular surgery</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">prolonged driving, use of digital screens (eg, computers, especially in upgaze), or reading</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">xerophthalmia</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Epithelial injury stimulates corneal nerve endings, resulting in symptoms such as ocular discomfort, increased blinking, and compensatory reflex lacrimal tear secretion. Loss of normal mucins on the ocular surface contributes to &#173;these symptoms by increasing frictional &#173;resistance between the eyelids and globe. During this period of abnormal corneal nerve stimulation, the high reflex input may cause neurogenic inflammation within the lacrimal gland.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Tear delivery may be negatively affected by conjunctival cicatrization or reduced by a decrease in the sensory reflex drive to the lacrimal gland (eg, following LASIK and photo&#173;refractive keratectomy), long-&#173;term contact lens wear, or long-&#173;term topical anesthetic use.</p>

Similarly, the symptom of itchy eyes can lead to the misdiagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Use of preservative-&#173;free lubricants often improves signs and symptoms of ATD.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The clinical &#173;presentation of ATD ranges from mild ocular irritation with minimal OSD to severe and disabling disease. Clinical signs of ATD include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">bulbar injection</li>

					</ul>
					<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The volume of tear production can be evaluated by Schirmer tests, which can be conducted with or without topical anesthesia. A reading of less than 5&#160;mm of wetting in the Schirmer I test is considered abnormal and consistent with ATD. The tear breakup time (TBUT) test helps to assess the quality and stability of the tear film. A rapid TBUT (ie, <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10 seconds) is consistent with rapid image degradation. &#173;These tests are discussed in Chapter&#160;2.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Slit-&#173;lamp examination</span> Examination at the slit lamp may reveal a reduced inferior tear meniscus (ie, approximately 0.2&#160;mm in height). Epithelial keratopathy—&#173;which can be fine and granular, coarse, or confluent—is best demonstrated &#173;after the instillation of fluorescein, lissamine green, or &#173;rose bengal dye. Lissamine green and &#173;rose bengal staining (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-11">Fig&#160;3-11</span>) can be more sensitive than fluorescein. It is impor&#173;tant to evaluate the entire surface, not simply the cornea. Lissamine green is particularly helpful for evaluating the conjunctiva; the staining may be seen at the nasal and temporal limbus, the inferior paracentral or midperipheral cornea <span class="h4-text_italic">(exposure staining),</span> and/or within the intrapalpebral conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-12">Fig&#160;3-12</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Filaments (strands of degenerating epithelial cells attached to the corneal surface over a core of mucus), as well as mucous plaques, may be seen in patients with severe ATD. Filamentary keratopathy can be quite painful, &#173;because &#173;these strands are firmly attached to the richly innervated surface epithelium and move with blinking (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-13">Fig&#160;3-13</span>). Marginal or paracentral corneal thinning and even perforation can occur in cases of severe dry eye. Incomplete blinking is frequently noted. Advanced disease may also involve calcium deposition or band keratopathy (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>), particularly in association with certain topical medi&#173;cations (especially glaucoma medi&#173;cations), chronic anterior uveitis, and keratinization of the cornea and conjunctiva.</p>

Although the precise &#173;causes of ATD in Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome are unknown, ATD is generally considered to be a T-&#173;cell–&#173;mediated inflammatory disease that leads to destruction of the lacrimal glands, in part by increasing the rate of apoptosis. Involvement of the salivary glands is common in Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, resulting in dry mouth and predisposing the patient to periodontal disease. Mucous membranes throughout the body (eg, vaginal, gastric, and respiratory mucosae) may also be affected, which can significantly affect quality of life.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome can be divided into 2 clinical subsets, primary and secondary. In primary Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, patients &#173;either have ill-&#173;defined systemic immune dysfunction or lack any evidence of immune dysfunction or connective tissue disease.

					<p class="h2">Evaporative Dry Eye</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaporative dry eye is increased evaporation of the tear film due to a dysfunctional lipid layer of the tear film. MGD is the primary abnormality associated with evaporative dry eye. According to the International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, MGD is divided into 2 main types on the basis of the volume of meibum produced: low-&#173;delivery and high-&#173;delivery states. A low-&#173;delivery state results from a hyposecretory state or obstructive disease. Hyposecretory states arise from gland atrophy or are medi&#173;cation induced. Obstructive MGD can be cicatricial (eg, trachoma, mucous membrane pemphigoid, or atopy) or noncicatricial (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, or atopy). Seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea may also cause a high-&#173;delivery state that is primarily dysfunctional &#173;because of the altered content of the meibum secreted.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Symptoms of evaporative dry eye, which are often worse in the morning, include</p>

					<p class="body-text">Extensive atrophy of the meibomian gland acini may develop &#173;after years of inflammation or obstruction from MGD, preventing expression of meibum with compression. Derangement of glandular architecture with shortening or tortuosity of the meibomian glands can be seen on transillumination of the everted eyelid using a muscle light or infrared photography (meibography) (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>).</p>

					<p class="h2">Treatment of Dry Eye</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before treatment of dry eye is initiated, it is impor&#173;tant to carefully examine the eye to rule out structural and exogenous disorders that can cause symptoms similar to &#173;those of dry eye (see Box for examples). In addition, the clinician should inquire &#173;whether the patient has any systemic conditions associated with dry eye (see &#173;Table&#160;3-7) or has used medi&#173;cations that can contribute to dry eye (
					<!--<span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-8">&#173;Table&#160;3-8</span>-->
					<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-8</span>
					). Medi&#173;cations with antihistaminic or anticholinergic properties increase dry eye symptoms. Also, the number of psychotropic agents a patient uses has been correlated with dry eye severity.</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-6"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="BCSC2025-26_S08_C03_p043_080_5P-web-resources/image/1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
					<p class="body-text">ATD and evaporative dry eye frequently coexist in OSD. Certain therapeutic interventions, such as artificial tear supplements, topical cyclosporine, topical lifitegrast, short pulses of topical corticosteroids, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements, can be helpful for both conditions. However, certain treatments for ATD may exacerbate evaporative dry eye. For example, punctal occlusion in the presence of active MGD increases the retention of the inflammatory meibum secretions. This therapy may be used once treatment of OSD inflammation is well &#173;under way.</p>
					<p class="h3">Medical management of aqueous tear deficiency</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Se&#173;lection of the treatment modalities for ATD depends on disease severity (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-9">&#173;Table&#160;3-9</span>). Patients with severe ATD can be counseled about ways to modify their environment to reduce tear film evaporation, such as using a desktop humidifier or moisture chamber glasses, which can be helpful. Smoking cessation may be helpful.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Changing or discontinuing topical or systemic medi&#173;cations that may contribute to ATD can be considered, although this is not always practical. Topical <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers have been associated with an increased incidence of dry eye, and many systemic medi&#173;cations (eg, diuretics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and psychotropic drugs) decrease aqueous tear production and increase dry eye symptoms. &#173;These drugs should be avoided, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, in patients with symptoms of ATD (see &#173;Table&#160;3-8). Depending on the severity of the patient’s symptoms and findings, communication with the prescribing physician may be warranted.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Tear substitutes</span> The mainstay of treatment for ATD is the use of tear substitutes (drops, gels, and ointments). Demulcents are polymers that can be added to artificial tear formulations to help improve lubricant properties; demulcent solutions have properties similar to &#173;those of mucomimetic agents, which can substitute for tear glycoproteins lost late in the disease &#173;process. However, demulcents alone cannot restore lost glycoproteins or conjunctival goblet cells, reduce corneal cell desquamation, or decrease tear film osmolarity. Liposomal sprays, which contain lipids, may provide tear film stabilization; they are applied to closed eyelids, reaching the tear film during blinking. For patients unable to instill artificial tears frequently, hydroxypropyl cellulose inserts are occasionally helpful. Perfluorohexyloctane, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023, is a prescription eyedrop that targets tear evaporation.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Preservative-&#173;free tear substitutes are recommended, especially for patients who regularly use tear substitutes, to avoid the toxic effects of preservatives.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Topical anti-&#173;inflammatory agents</span> In patients with ATD, topical anti-&#173;inflammatory agents offer considerable benefit in controlling the associated ocular surface inflammation, and their use is typically initiated early in the disease course. Topical cyclosporine 0.05% and 0.09% address the inflammatory component of moderate to severe ATD. A 0.1% formulation is available in &#173;Europe for nightly use. Therapy is often initiated in combination with a short course (1–4 weeks) of topical corticosteroids to provide an initial reduction in surface inflammation. Patients should be advised that stinging upon instillation is pos&#173;si&#173;ble and, further, that it may take several weeks to months of use before they obtain symptomatic relief.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Topical lifitegrast 5% may inhibit the migration and activation of T cells and the subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. Patients may see results within 2 to 6 weeks of beginning treatment. Lifitegrast can cause mild ocular irritation, transient blurred vision, and altered taste perception.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Autologous serum, hyaluronic acid, and hormonal therapies</span> Other treatments that have been successful in severe ATD include dilute solutions of autologous serum and hyaluronic acid. Autologous serum drops require blood drawn from the patient. The tubes are spun to separate the serum and are sent to a compounding pharmacy, which prepares a 20% to 50% solution for patient use. &#173;There are companies in the United States that facilitate specimen collection and then prepare and ship serum tears. Studies on the efficacy of serum tears in patients with secondary Sj<span class="h4-text_cyrillic">ӧ</span>gren syndrome have shown mixed results, presumably &#173;because inflammatory cytokines may be pre&#173;sent in the serum. In advanced dry eye disease, off-&#173;label use of hormonal therapies such as topical 0.03% testosterone eyedrops and topical progesterone cream have been effective in reducing signs and improving symptoms.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment of filamentary keratopathy</span> Treating the filamentary keratopathy associated with severe ATD can be challenging. Filaments are debrided with a cotton swab moistened with topical anesthetic or a jeweler’s forceps. Treatment directed at improving the tear film function may reduce the severity of recurrence. In addition to tear supplementation and punctal occlusion, topical acetylcysteine 10%, a mucolytic agent formulated by a compounding pharmacy, can further reduce filament formation. Although therapeutic &#173;bandage contact lenses may help impede filament formation, they are rarely used to reduce symptoms in patients with ATD &#173;because of the associated increased risk of infectious keratitis. Close observation is warranted in patients with ATD who wear &#173;these lenses. In contrast, scleral contact lenses have been found to be quite helpful in patients with advanced dry eye symptoms.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Moisture chamber glasses</span> In cases of severe ATD, the use of moisture chamber glasses (glasses or sunglasses incorporating a moisture shield or seal, or goggles) can decrease tear evaporation. Unfortunately, many patients find this therapy cosmetically objectionable.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Stimulation of tear secre</span><span class="h4-head">tion</span> Tear secretion rates may be increased by pharmacologic, electrical, or mechanical forms of stimulation. In more severe cases of ATD, pharmacologic stimulation of tear secretion has been used with varying success. The cholinergic agonists pilocarpine and cevimeline hydrochloride stimulate muscarinic receptors pre&#173;sent in salivary and lacrimal glands, thereby increasing secretion. Although studies have shown &#173;these agents to be effective in treating both xerostomia and dry eye in patients with Sj<span class="h4-text_accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, they are approved by the FDA only for the treatment of xerostomia. It is uncertain &#173;whether &#173;these agents provide long-&#173;term benefits, and they are associated with significant adverse effects.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Varenicline solution nasal spray, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist used twice daily, was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms. In phase 3 &#173;trials, nonocular adverse effects such as sneezing, cough, throat irritation, and instillation site irritation &#173;were common but mild. Varenicline was initially approved as a smoking cessation agent.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Neurostimulation of tear secretion was previously accomplished with a device that employed electrical current to intranasally stimulate the nasolacrimal nerve, a branch of cranial nerve V. This device is no longer available. A device that externally stimulates the nasal nerve was approved by the FDA in 2020 for at-&#173;home use to increase tear production during vibratory stimulation. This device, which oscillates at a frequency between 250 and 270&#160;Hz, has not been approved for the treatment of dry eye.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Dietary supplementation</span> Certain fish (eg, salmon, tuna, cod, flounder) and crustaceans (eg, shrimp, crab), flaxseed oil, dark leafy greens, and walnuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which block proinflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines. Commercial preparations of oral omega-3 fatty acids are available. While supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to increase average tear production and tear volume, numerous clinical studies on the efficacy of this supplementation have shown conflicting results (eg, the Dry Eye Assessment and Management [DREAM] Study).</p>

					<p class="h3">Surgical management of aqueous tear deficiency</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgical treatment is generally reserved for patients in whom medical treatment is &#173;either inadequate or impractical. Patients with moderate to severe ATD may benefit from punctal occlusion, a technique to reduce normal tear drainage so that more fluid is retained on the ocular surface. Punctal occlusion can be temporary, semipermanent, or permanent.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Reversible punctal occlusion</span> Reversible punctal occlusion, the effectiveness of which varies, can be performed by applying topical anesthesia, dilating the punctum (as needed), and inserting &#173;either a collagen or silicone punctal plug (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-15">Fig&#160;3-15</span>, Video&#160;3-2). Collagen plugs usually dissolve within days and do not provide complete canalicular occlusion. Intracanalicular plugs can be viewed by transillumination of the eyelid, enabling clinicians to check &#173;whether the plugs have dissolved, fallen out, or migrated. Infectious canaliculitis and sterile inflammation have been reported in the setting of intracanalicular plugs.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Silicone plugs may remain in place for months or years &#173;unless they are undersized or are manually displaced. Some plugs have a small hole bored through the center to reduce the likelihood of epiphora. Most silicone plugs are continuously vis&#173;i&#173;ble at the slit lamp, so it is readily apparent if they fall out or migrate into the canaliculus.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If inserted too forcefully, punctal plugs can be inadvertently inserted into the canaliculus and may require surgical removal. If a plug protrudes from the punctum, conjunctival irritation or abrasion may occur. If granuloma formation at the punctal opening occurs, removal of the plug and pos&#173;si&#173;ble excision may be required.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Permanent punctal occlusion</span> A disposable cautery, a hyfrecator, or a radiofrequency probe may be used to perform permanent punctal occlusion. Local anesthesia is typically required. Although the procedure is usually irreversible when successful, the canaliculus and puncta may spontaneously reopen. Punctal cautery can result in epiphora. This is an impor&#173;tant consideration, especially when both the upper and lower puncta are cauterized.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The value of punctal occlusion for patients with OSD other than tear deficiency is unproven. The procedure is recommended primarily for patients who have minimal basal tear secretion and punctate keratopathy but no significant ocular surface inflammation or infection.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Correction of eyelid malposition and tarsorrhaphy</span> Another potentially beneficial treatment for patients with dry eye symptoms is correction of eyelid malposition (eg, entropion, ectropion, lower-&#173;eyelid laxity, and lagophthalmos). Reduction of the palpebral aperture by means of lateral and/or medial tarsorrhaphy can be performed in cases of severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca when more conservative &#173;measures have failed. However, lateral tarsorrhaphy may limit the temporal visual field and produce an undesirable cosmetic deformity.</p>
					<p class="h3">Medical management of evaporative dry eye</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are dif&#173;fer&#173;ent approaches to the management of evaporative dry eye, but in general, a stepwise approach based on symptoms and disease severity is used. Medical treatment ranges from eyelid hygiene to systemic treatment with oral tetracycline.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Eyelid hygiene</span> In the management of MGD, eyelid hygiene is an essential part at all stages of the disease (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 3-10">&#173;Table&#160;3-10</span>); the goal is improving meibomian gland function and meibum quality. Application of warm compresses to the eyelids twice daily for 3–5 minutes liquefies thickened meibomian gland secretions and softens adherent crusts on the eyelid margins. The patient should be warned to avoid excessive or uneven heat if a &#173;microwave is used for the compress. The application of heat is followed by moderate-&#173;force, firm, and continuous (4-&#173;second hold) compression of the eyelid margin to express meibomian secretions. Compression can be followed by cleansing of the closed eyelids by &#173;gently rubbing the eyelid margin with a clean washcloth or a commercially available pad. A solution prepared by mixing a nonirritating shampoo and &#173;water, or commercially available solutions containing hypochlorous acid designed for this purpose may facilitate cleansing.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Topical antibiotic for eyelid disease</span> Short-&#173;term pulse (periodic) topical antibiotic therapy reduces the bacterial load on the eyelid margin. Topical azithromycin ophthalmic solution may be particularly efficacious, &#173;because it is a lipophilic antibiotic that reduces the production of bacterial lipases and improves the composition of meibomian lipids. The high viscosity of the drop prolongs the contact time and aids penetration into the glands. Long-&#173;term use of topical antibiotics or subtherapeutic dosing can result in the development of resistant organisms; however, due to the high minimum inhibitory concentration value of azithromycin, this should not be expected. Azithromycin also has direct anti-&#173;inflammatory effects on the eyelids and ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Topical corticosteroids</span> In cases with moderate to severe eyelid inflammation, topical corticosteroids may be required for short periods, particularly when corneal infiltrates and vascularization are pre&#173;sent.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Oral tetracycline</span> The tetracycline class of antibiotics includes doxycycline and minocycline. Treatment with oral tetracyclines can be very effective &#173;because of their antibiotic and anti-&#173;inflammatory effects; however, patients with MGD should be informed that this treatment may only control their condition, not eliminate it. &#173;Because tetracycline should be taken on an empty stomach and requires more frequent dosing, doxycycline and minocycline are typically used. Doxycycline can be started at 50&#160;mg twice daily and tapered to 50&#160;mg daily. Larger doses are usually unnecessary, and lower doses are less likely to cause stomach upset. Minocycline is typically administered as 100&#160;mg daily. Lower doses of both drugs may also be effective. A typical course is 4 to 6 weeks but can be repeated, or continued for several months, to achieve long-&#173;term control. An alternative long-&#173;term approach is to use the medi&#173;cation for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off the medi&#173;cation, repeated monthly. Erythromycin can be used as alternative therapy in &#173;children or in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">PATHOGENESIS</span> Rosacea has no proven cause; staphylococcal bacteria and <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> mites <span class="h5-text_italic">(Demodex brevis, Demodex folliculorum)</span> have been implicated. Rosacea is associated with cutaneous sebaceous gland dysfunction of the face, neck, and shoulders. Although rosacea has generally been thought to be more common in fair-&#173;skinned individuals, it may simply be more difficult to diagnose in patients with dark skin. Alcohol consumption can contribute to a worsening of facial redness &#173;because of its effect on vasomotor stability with dilatation of vessels; however, most patients with rosacea do not have a history of excessive alcohol intake. In some patients, exacerbation can be triggered by emotional stress, ingestion of hot or spicy foods, or a hot or cold environment. &#173;These associations have not been proven to be causal or modifiable risk &#173;factors. Repeated bouts of ocular surface inflammation can cause corneal neovascularization and scarring (Fig&#160;3-16D).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> If properly treated, the corneal involvement can be controlled with few sequelae. <span class="keypoint_underline">Oral tetracyclines are the mainstay of therapy for both the ocular and skin disease.</span> Tetracyclines have anti-&#173;inflammatory properties that include suppression of leukocyte migration, reduced production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases, and inhibition of phospholipase A<span class="h5-text_subscript CharOverride-3">2</span>. In addition, tetracyclines may reduce irritative &#173;free fatty acids and diglycerides by suppressing bacterial lipases. Doxycycline and minocycline are the tetracycline antibiotics typically used. Erythromycin or azithromycin may be used when tetracyclines are not appropriate.</p>

					<p class="body-text">With time, oral therapy with doxycycline or minocycline can be tapered. In addition to oral therapy, topical therapy with metronidazole gel 0.75%, metronidazole cream 1%, or azelaic acid gel 15% applied to the affected facial areas can significantly reduce facial erythema. Azelaic acid 15% is thought to suppress rosacea through anti-&#173;inflammatory and antimicrobial mechanisms. Ivermectin 1% cream is effective in reducing signs and symptoms of rosacea through both anti-&#173;inflammatory and anti-&#173;parasitic mechanisms.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Ulcerative keratitis associated with rosacea can result from an infectious or a sterile inflammatory &#173;process. If it is determined that the ulcer is noninfectious, topical corticosteroids, used judiciously, can play a substantial role in reducing inflammation and promoting reepithelialization of the cornea. In advanced cases with scarring and neovascularization, conservative therapy is generally recommended. Penetrating keratoplasty is a high-&#173;risk procedure in patients with rosacea &#173;because of corneal vascularization, corneal thinning, and a compromised ocular surface. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty could be considered in patients who need a corneal transplant.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">CLINICAL &#173;PRESENTATION</span> Patients with <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> blepharitis typically have eyelash sleeves, called <span class="h5-text_italic">cylindrical dandruff</span> (or <span class="h5-text_italic">collarettes</span> in some sources) (Fig&#160;3-17C). In fact, approximately half of all patients seeking eye care for any reason have this sign. Investigations suggest that patients lacking this finding have approximately a 20% probability of <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> blepharitis, whereas patients with cylindrical dandruff have a 100% probability of this infestation. Moreover, <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> infestation rates increase with age, from less than 20% in &#173;children and adolescents to a majority of adults. However, it is unclear &#173;whether <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> mites are always pathogenic. <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> blepharitis may play a causative role in tear film abnormalities, MGD, eyelid erythema and edema, recurrent chalazia, trichiasis, and vari&#173;ous OSDs associated with blepharitis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> Treatments to eradicate <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> mites are available, and improvement in signs and symptoms of blepharitis suggests a causative role for this pathogen. A small case series found that, when weekly 50% tea tree oil eyelid scrubs and daily tea tree oil shampoo scrubs &#173;were used for a minimum of 6 weeks in a group of patients who had not previously improved with eyelid hygiene and concurrent scalp treatment, symptoms and signs improved among participants. Although eyelid treatments with hypochlorous acid have been clinically effective in some studies, laboratory studies have not demonstrated that the adult <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> mites are effectively killed. Oral ivermectin has also been reported to be of benefit in some cases of recalcitrant <span class="h5-text_italic">Demodex</span> blepharitis. Weekly use of ivermectin 1% cream, applied to the eyelashes for 15 minutes, has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms; ocular surface staining; and eyelid debris, redness, and swelling when compared with eyelid hygiene alone.

					<p class="h2">Staphylococcal Blepharitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In general, the term <span class="italic">staphylococcal blepharitis</span> (caused typically by <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> but occasionally by other species) refers to cases in which bacterial infection of the eyelids (and frequently the conjunctiva) is predominant. In contrast, MGD and seborrheic blepharitis are primarily noninfectious inflammatory conditions. Clinical features that may help in the differential diagnosis of &#173;these conditions are summarized in &#173;Table&#160;3-11.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">CLINICAL &#173;PRESENTATION</span> Staphylococcal blepharitis is seen more commonly than other forms of blepharitis in youn&#173;ger individuals. Symptoms are typically worse in the morning and improve as the day progresses. Clinical symptoms include burning, itching, foreign-&#173;body sensation, and crusting, particularly upon awakening.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Clinical signs include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">hard scales and matted, flattened crusts surrounding individual cilia (Fig&#160;3-17D)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">small ulcers of the anterior eyelid margin; occasionally noted; vis&#173;i&#173;ble when the crusts are removed (see Fig&#160;3-17)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">injection and telangiectasis of the anterior and posterior eyelid margins</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">white lashes (poliosis), loss of lashes (madarosis), and trichiasis in varying degrees, worsening with increased severity and duration of staphylococcal blepharitis</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> Effective treatment addresses both the infection and the associated inflammation. Eyelid hygiene—&#173;with &#173;either commercially available eyelid scrubs, warm &#173;water mixed with baby shampoo, or hypochlorous acid sprays—&#173;may help reduce bacterial colonization and the accumulation of sebaceous secretions. &#173;These treatments should focus on the base of the lashes, where colonization and seborrhea are greatest. Aggressive scrubbing should be discouraged. Topical antibiotics such as bacitracin, erythromycin, azithromycin, or tobramycin may be applied to the eyelid margin to reduce both the bacterial load and associated inflammation. As stated, ATD and/or lipid-&#173;induced tear film instability (evaporative dry eye) may occur concomitantly; &#173;these should be treated to improve patient comfort.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Topical corticosteroids can be helpful in selected cases. Patients with routine staphylococcal blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis obtain rapid symptomatic relief with a short course of topical corticosteroids. If epithelial defects are noted over the corneal infiltrates, diagnostic cultures should be considered before corticosteroid treatment is begun. Long-&#173;term or indiscriminate use of corticosteroids is not recommended.</p>

					<p class="h2">Marginal Keratitis Associated With Staphylococcal Blepharitis</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">CLINICAL &#173;PRESENTATION</span> Several forms of keratitis may develop in association with staphylococcal blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis. The findings range from punctate epithelial keratopathy to marginal corneal infiltrates, as seen in immune-&#173;mediated keratitis, referred to as <span class="h5-text_italic">marginal keratitis.</span> Asymmetric or unilateral keratopathy is often seen.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-3"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Marginal keratitis can occur even when eyelid inflammation is minimal, a circumstance that may lead to diagnostic confusion. Marginal corneal infiltrates have a distinctive clinical appearance, with creamy white elliptical opacities typically separated from the limbus by a relatively lucent zone. They most often occur near the point of intersection of the eyelid margin and the limbus, that is, at the 10, 2, 4, and 8 &#173;o’clock positions (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-18">Fig&#160;3-18</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The infiltrates of marginal keratitis represent an inflammatory reaction to staphylococcal blepharitis. The limbal location of marginal keratitis is related to the cornea’s proximity to limbal vessels, which permits a variety of immune phenomena, as is the case with other types of immune-&#173;related keratitis (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>). Although the aforementioned findings are typical, the marginal lesions can occur at other locations and without a clear zone. The epithelium overlying marginal infiltrates may be intact, show punctate erosions, or be absent.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> See the “Management” subsection &#173;under Staphylococcal Blepharitis. Staphy&#173;lococcal marginal keratitis readily responds to topical &#173;steroids, used judiciously and in concert with antibiotic therapy and eyelid hygiene. Topical cyclosporine may be used as a steroid-&#173;sparing anti-&#173;inflammatory agent. If the keratitis does not improve or it worsens with topical &#173;steroid treatment, consideration of an infectious etiology is advised.</p>
					<p class="h2">Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis (Phlyctenulosis)</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">CLINICAL &#173;PRESENTATION</span> Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis can be associated with staphylococcal blepharitis, as well as other conditions. This keratoconjunctivitis is marked by the formation of phlyctenules, which are hyperemic, focal nodules consisting of chronic inflammatory cells. They often pre&#173;sent unilaterally at or near the limbus, on the bulbar conjunctiva or cornea, as small, round, elevated gray or yellow nodules accompanied by a zone of hyperemic vessels (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-19">Fig&#160;3-19A</span>). Phlyctenules typically become necrotic and ulcerate centrally; they then spontaneously involute over a period of 2–3 weeks. Conjunctival phlyctenules do not lead to scarring, but residual wedge-&#173;shaped fibrovascular corneal scars form along the limbus. When such scars are bilateral and inferior, they may suggest previous phlyctenulosis. Corneal involvement, also known as <span class="h5-text_italic">fascicular keratitis</span> or <span class="h5-text_italic">phlyctenular keratitis,</span> can be recurrent, and migration of successive inflammatory lesions with a leash of neovascularization may occur, affecting vision if untreated (Fig&#160;3-19B). Occasionally, such inflammation leads to corneal thinning and, in rare cases, perforation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">PATHOGENESIS</span> Phlyctenulosis is believed to represent a T-&#173;cell–&#173;mediated, or delayed, hypersensitivity (type IV) response induced by microbial antigens such as the cell wall components of staphylococcus. Two specific requirements must be met in order for this delayed hypersensitivity reaction to develop: (1) sensitization of the cornea and conjunctiva to an antigen; and (2) repeated exposure to this antigen. <span class="keypoint_underline">Phlyctenulosis is most frequently associated with </span>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> See the “Management” subsection &#173;under Staphylococcal Blepharitis. As with staphylococcal marginal keratitis, phlyctenulosis readily responds to topical &#173;steroids used judiciously in concert with antibiotic therapy and eyelid hygiene. Serologic or skin testing is advised when tuberculosis is a possibility based on &#173;family history or review of systems. Long-&#173;term treatment is frequently necessary.</p>
					<p class="h2">Hordeola and Chalazia</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">CLINICAL &#173;PRESENTATION</span> Hordeola pre&#173;sent as painful, tender red nodular masses near the eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 3-20">Fig&#160;3-20</span>). &#173;Those occurring on the anterior eyelid in the glands of Zeis or lash follicles are called <span class="h5-text_italic">external hordeola,</span> or <span class="h5-text_italic">styes.</span> Hordeola occurring on the posterior eyelid from meibomian gland inspissation are termed <span class="h5-text_italic">internal hordeola.</span> Both types are associated with a localized purulent abscess, usually caused by <span class="h5-text_italic">S aureus</span> infection, and may rupture, producing a purulent discharge. Hordeola are generally self-&#173;limited, improving spontaneously over the course of 1–2 weeks.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Internal hordeola occasionally evolve into chalazia, which are chronic lipogranulomatous nodules involving the meibomian glands. The lesion resolves in weeks to months. A small amount of scar tissue or calcium inclusions may remain. Occasionally, patients with a chalazion experience blurred vision secondary to astigmatism, which is induced by the pressure of the chalazion on the globe.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Basal cell, squamous cell, and sebaceous cell carcinoma can masquerade as a chalazion or chronic blepharitis. The histopathologic examination of a per&#173;sis&#173;tent, recurrent, or aty&#173;pi&#173;cal chalazion is therefore impor&#173;tant. Lash loss occurring over a chronic lesion is suggestive of malignancy.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">MANAGEMENT</span> Cultures are not indicated for isolated, uncomplicated cases of hordeolum or chalazion. Warm compresses and eyelid hygiene are considered first-&#173;line treatment and can facilitate spontaneous drainage. Topically applied antibiotics are generally not effective and, therefore, are not indicated &#173;unless infectious blepharoconjunctivitis is pre&#173;sent. Systemic antibiotics are generally indicated only in cases of secondary eyelid cellulitis. If the patient has accompanying MGD or a recurrent chalazion, oral doxycycline can be helpful.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If an internal hordeolum evolves into a chalazion that fails to respond to warm compresses and eyelid hygiene, intralesional injection of a corticosteroid (eg, 0.1–0.2&#160;mL of triamcinolone acetonide 40&#160;mg/mL), incision and curettage, or both may be necessary. In general, intralesional corticosteroid injection works best with small chalazia, chalazia on the eyelid margin, and multiple chalazia. In patients with dark skin, intralesional corticosteroid injection may lead to eyelid skin depigmentation and thus should be used with caution.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Large chalazia are best treated with surgical drainage and curettage. Internal chalazia require vertical incisions through the palpebral conjunctiva along the meibomian gland to facilitate drainage and avoid horizontal scarring of the tarsal plates. Surgical drainage usually requires perilesional, local anesthesia. For recurrent chalazia, a biopsy for pathologic evaluation should be performed to rule out meibomian gland carcinoma. Oral doxycycline and eyelid hygiene have been shown to be beneficial in reducing the incidence of recurrent chalazion. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;7</span>, <span class="italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery,</span> for further discussion of chalazion.</p>
