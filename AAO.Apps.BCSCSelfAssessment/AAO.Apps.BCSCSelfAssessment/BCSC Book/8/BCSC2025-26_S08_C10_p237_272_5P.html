					<p class="h3">Cystinosis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by accumulation of the amino acid cystine within lysosomes. The disease affects 35 infants per 10 million births.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Cystinosis is characterized by the deposition of fine iridescent and polychromatic cystine crystals in the conjunctiva, cornea, iris, and other parts of the eye. The crystals are densest in the peripheral cornea but are pre&#173;sent throughout the anterior stroma, even within the central cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-1">Fig&#160;10-1</span>), and can be observed in the trabecular meshwork with gonioscopy. Patients with cystinosis often have photophobia, and the crystals can recur &#173;after penetrating keratoplasty (PK).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Cystinosis is categorized as nephropathic or nonnephropathic on the basis of the patient’s age at diagnosis and the presence or severity of renal involvement. <span class="italic">Nephropathic cystinosis</span> is further divided into infantile (classic) and intermediate (juvenile or adolescent) forms. Dwarfism and progressive renal dysfunction are prominent in infantile cystinosis and less severe in the juvenile disease. In <span class="italic">nonnephropathic cystinosis</span> (formerly called <span class="italic">adult cystinosis</span>), the kidneys are not affected, and life expectancy is normal. <span class="xref-table" id="Table 10-2">&#173;Table&#160;10-2</span> lists other &#173;causes of corneal crystals.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> In cystinosis, a defect in the <span class="h5-text_italic">CTNS</span> gene, mapped to 17p13, disrupts the transport of cystine across the lysosomal membrane. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cystine and eventually the formation of crystals in affected body tissues, mainly the kidney and eye.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Cystine crystals may be seen in conjunctiva, blood leukocytes, and bone marrow. <span class="keypoint_underline">Conjunctival biopsy specimens should be submitted in glutaraldehyde solution to avoid dissolving the crystals.</span></p>

					</div>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Oral cysteamine bitartrate and topical cysteamine 0.44% are commercially available agents used to treat cystinosis. Cysteamine reacts with intracellular cystine, forming a cysteine–&#173;cysteamine disulfide that is transported through the lysosome by the normal lysine transport system, thereby depleting the cystinotic cells of cystine. In addition, cysteamine diminishes corneal pain, possibly by reducing the frequency of corneal erosions. Oral cysteamine is also used to treat posterior segment manifestations such as pigmentary retinopathy and optic nerve involvement, which may also prevent or stabilize renal function.</p>
					<p class="h3">Tyrosinemia</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tyrosinemia encompasses a group of inborn errors in the metabolism of the amino acid tyrosine.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> &#173;There are several subtypes of tyrosinemia, but only type II is associated with corneal opacity. In tyrosinemia type II (Richner-&#173;Hanhart syndrome), the most frequently observed ocular signs and symptoms are marked photophobia, tearing, conjunctival hyperemia, and tarsal papillary hypertrophy. Affected patients may also show hyperkeratotic lesions of the palms, &#173;soles, and elbows, as well as cognitive impairment. Slit-&#173;lamp examination may show pseudodendrites.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Patients with tyrosinemia can experience recurrent episodes of corneal erosions and pseudodendrites (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-2">Fig&#160;10-2</span>), which usually do not stain well with fluorescein or &#173;rose bengal. Continued episodes of epithelial breakdown can result in corneal vascularization and scarring. It is impor&#173;tant to consider this disorder in young &#173;children who may carry a diagnosis of bilateral recurrent herpes simplex virus keratitis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Tyrosinemia type II is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defective tyrosine aminotransferase, which leads to excess tyrosine in the blood and urine. The elevated tyrosine levels likely have a direct effect on lysosomal membranes, leading to enzyme release. The disorder results from pathogenic variants in <span class="h5-text_italic">TAT,</span> located at 16q22.1–22.3.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Diagnosis is confirmed by hypertyrosinemia and tyrosinuria with normal phenylalanine levels and a conjunctival biopsy specimen showing soluble tyrosine aminotransferase deficiency.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Restricted dietary intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine can reduce the severity of both the corneal and systemic changes of tyrosinemia, including cognitive impairment. Appropriate dietary restrictions can also improve &#173;mental status, even &#173;later in life. For patients with type I tyrosinemia, nitisinone, a drug involved in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine, has shown promise as treatment.</p>

					<p class="h3">Alkaptonuria</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase (also known as <span class="italic">homogentisate 1,2-&#173;dioxygenase</span>), which leads to an accumulation of homogentisic acid.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Darkly pigmented, dotlike opacities, similar to &#173;those seen in spheroidal degeneration, may appear in the corneal epithelium or in Bowman layer near the limbus. The medial and lateral rectus muscle tendons and the sclera adjacent to the tendon insertions develop a smudgelike, bluish-&#173;black pigmentation (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 10-3">Fig&#160;10-3</span>). Systemic findings include arthropathy; renal calculi; and pigmentation of cartilaginous structures, including earlobes, trachea, nose, tendons, dura mater, heart valves, and prostate.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Patients with alkaptonuria have a deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase, the enzyme involved in the degradation pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine. The defect is caused by pathogenic variants in the <span class="h5-text_italic">HGD</span> gene, which maps to 3q13.33. The enzyme deficiency leads to a buildup of homogentisic acid, which is oxidized and polymerized into alkapton, a brown-&#173;black material similar to melanin. Alkapton binds to collagen and is then deposited in connective tissues as a dark pigment, a &#173;process known as <span class="h5-text_italic">ochronosis.</span></p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Elevated levels of homogentisic acid in the urine are diagnostic for alkaptonuria. The urine of affected patients turns dark on standing.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Dietary restriction of phenylalanine and tyrosine may have a &#173;limited role in the excretion of homogentisic acids; however, no specific therapy is available for alkaptonuria at this time.</p>
					<p class="h2">Protein Disorders</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Amyloidoses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The amyloidoses are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid in vari&#173;ous tissues and organs, including the cornea and conjunctiva. Amyloid deposits may be composed of many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types of proteins, including immunoglobulin fragments. The deposits are insoluble and inert, but they interfere with the normal structure and function of tissues and organs.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Ocular amyloidosis is classified as &#173;either primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with a chronic disease) and as &#173;either localized or systemic. A useful classification of the amyloidoses considers &#173;these 4 types, as summarized in 
					<!--<span class="xref-table" id="Table 10-3">&#173;Table&#160;10-3</span>-->
					<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;10-3</span>
					.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> <span class="h5-text_italic">Primary localized amyloidosis</span> is the most common form of ocular amyloidosis. Conjunctival amyloid plaques occur in the absence of systemic involvement (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 10-4">Fig&#160;10-4</span>). Gelatinous droplike corneal dystrophy (formerly primary familial amyloidosis), classic lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD; also called <span class="h5-text_italic">LCD type 1</span>), and lattice variants are special forms of primary localized amyloidosis and are discussed in Chapter&#160;8. Polymorphic amyloid degeneration is discussed in Chapter&#160;6.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Primary systemic amyloidosis</span> is a heterogeneous group of diseases in which waxy, ecchymotic eyelid papules occur in association with vitreous veils and opacities as well as with pupillary anomalies such as light–&#173;near dissociation. Orbital involvement, extraocular muscle involvement with ophthalmoplegia, and scleral infiltration with uveal effusion have been reported. The most common form of primary systemic amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant group of diseases linked to pathogenic variants in the transthyretin gene (<span class="italic">TTR,</span> prealbumin) on chromosome 18 (18q11.2–&#173;q12.1); more than 40 variants in this gene have been described.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Meretoja syndrome</span> is a familial form of primary systemic amyloidosis that pre&#173;sents in the third to fourth &#173;decade of life. Affected patients have a characteristic facies; dermatochalasis; lagophthalmos; pendulous ears; cranial and peripheral nerve palsies; and dry, lax skin with amyloid deposition (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-5">Fig&#160;10-5</span>). The ophthalmologist is often the first physician to see patients with this condition, who typically pre&#173;sent with corneal findings similar to &#173;those in LCD.&#160;In&#160;LCD, the corneal lattice lines typically start centrally and superficially and spread peripherally, becoming deeper, whereas in familial amyloidosis, the central cornea is relatively spared and sensation is reduced. In addition, the risk of open-&#173;angle glaucoma may be increased, and dry eye and recurrent erosions may occur late in life.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathology of familial amyloidosis</span> Light microscopy shows amyloid in the lattice lines as a discontinuous band &#173;under Bowman layer and within the sclera. The amyloid in this condition is related to gelsolin and is deposited in the conjunctiva, sclera, and ciliary body; along the choriocapillaris; in the ciliary nerves and vessels; and in the optic nerve. On confocal microscopy, deposits are observed along the basal epithelial cells and stromal nerves. On electron microscopy, amyloid has a typical filamentous appearance. Outside the eye, amyloid is detected in arterial walls, peripheral nerves, and glomeruli.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Amyloid has the following histologic staining characteristics:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">staining with Congo red stain (see <span class="bullet-list_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>, Fig&#160;8-12A)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">dichroism and apple-&#173;green birefringence (see <span class="bullet-list_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>, Fig&#160;8-12B)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">metachromasia with crystal violet dye</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">fluorescence in UV light with thioflavin T stain</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treating the systemic manifestations of amyloidosis requires a team approach. For example, when diplopia occurs due to cranial nerve dysfunction, vitreous involvement, or glaucoma, collaboration with ocular subspecialists is required. In contrast, conjunctival involvement usually does not require treatment. In patients who exhibit marked stromal disease, superficial corneal disease associated with significant visual dysfunction can be managed with phototherapeutic keratectomy or with PK or lamellar keratoplasty (LK). However, the under&#173;lying condition may recur. Management of recurrent erosions due to corneal involvement is discussed in Chapter&#160;8.</p>

					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Gout</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders of purine metabolism cause <span class="italic">hyperuricemia</span> (increased serum uric acid). <span class="italic">Gout</span> results from deposition of urate crystals in the joints or kidney.</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Acute inflammation of the sclera, episclera, or conjunctiva can occur with gout. In the absence of inflammation, fine corneal epithelial and stromal deposits may appear. In rare cases, &#173;either an orange-&#173;brown band keratopathy or a typical whitish band keratopathy is seen.</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Hyperuricemia may be familial, arising from an enzyme deficiency (eg, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase as occurs in Lesch-&#173;Nyhan syndrome). More commonly, gout is polygenic or secondary to obesity, cytotoxic chemotherapy, myeloproliferative disease, diuretic therapy, or excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Serum uric acid level is typically elevated in patients with gout. However, in &#173;those with urate keratopathy, the uric acid level may be normal when &#173;there is no concurrent inflammation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Indomethacin, colchicine, or phenylbutazone is used for acute treatment of gout; long-&#173;term reduction in uric acid levels should be pursued with medi&#173;cations such as allopurinol. Superficial corneal deposits can be removed mechanically with scraping or keratectomy.</p>

					<p class="h3-h2">Wilson disease</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wilson disease (also known as <span class="italic">hepatolenticular degeneration</span>) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in copper deposition in multiple organs of the body, including ocular structures.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In Wilson disease, muscular rigidity increases, and tremor and involuntary movement gradually occur in a fluctuating course resembling parkinsonism. Unintelligible speech and mild dementia usually occur concomitantly. Hepatic, psychiatric, or &#173;nervous system symptoms are reported in 40% of patients.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In the cornea, a golden-&#173;brown, ruby-&#173;red, or green pigment ring (Kayser-&#173;Fleischer ring) consisting of copper deposits may appear in the peripheral Descemet membrane (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 10-6">Fig&#160;10-6;</span> see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>, Fig&#160;6-11), although not all patients with Wilson disease manifest this ring. <span class="keypoint_underline">A Kayser-&#173;Fleischer (posterior cornea) ring can also occur in Descemet membrane in association with other conditions (eg, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, multiple myeloma, and chalcosis) and should not be confused with the subepithelial iron (anterior cornea) ring seen in keratoconus (ie, Fleischer ring).</span> Gonioscopy may assist in visualizing the ring.

					</div>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Wilson disease is due to pathogenic variants in the <span class="h5-text_italic">ATP7B</span> gene (13q14.3–&#173;q21), which result in defects in the transport of copper and elimination of excess copper from the body. &#173;Because of &#173;these defects, copper is deposited first in the liver, then in the kidneys, and eventually in the brain and the cornea at the level of Descemet membrane (see Fig&#160;10-6).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Low serum ceruloplasmin, high non<span class="h5-text_figuredash">‒</span>ceruloplasmin-&#173;bound serum copper, and high urinary copper levels are suggestive of Wilson disease, which can be confirmed with liver biopsy and the radioactive copper incorporation test. Nonspecific findings of proteinuria, aminoaciduria, glycosuria, uricaciduria, hyperphosphaturia, and hypercalciuria are also noted.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Wilson disease can be treated with penicillamine. Liver transplant is reserved for patients with fulminant liver failure. The Kayser-&#173;Fleischer ring dis&#173;appears gradually with therapy, including liver transplant, and the disappearance of the rings can be used to help monitor therapy. Electrophysiologic abnormalities from ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction typically improve &#173;after treatment of the disease.</p>
					<p class="h3">Porphyrias</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The porphyrias are a group of disorders characterized by excess production and excretion of porphyrins, pigments involved in the synthesis of heme, specifically the nonprotein part of hemoglobin. The porphyrins accumulate in the liver, skin, and bone marrow of patients with &#173;these disorders. <span class="italic">Porphyria cutanea tarda,</span> the form most commonly associated with ocular surface disease, is &#173;either sporadic or inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (chromosome band 1p34).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Signs of porphyria include hyperpigmentation, erythema, scleroderma-&#173;like changes, increased fragility, and vesicular and ulcerative lesions that occur on sun-&#173;exposed surfaces of the body, including the conjunctiva and cornea. Interpalpebral injection is seen, and the conjunctiva may develop vesicles, scarring, and symblephara that mimic bullous pemphigoid. Conjunctival necrosis may also occur. Necrotizing scleritis has been reported. The cornea may be affected by exposure or by thinning and perforation at the limbus.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> In porphyria, the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is deficient, resulting in an accumulation of porphyrins in the liver and the circulation. Typically, a second insult to the liver, such as alcoholism or drug metabolism, triggers the condition in late &#173;middle age.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A severe form of porphyria, called <span class="italic">hepatoerythropoietic porphyria,</span> is a rare homozygous &#173;presentation of the same enzymatic defect, but onset of the disease is in infancy.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Reduced levels of liver and red-&#173;cell uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase confirm the diagnosis. Hepatic biopsy shows liver parenchymal cells filled with porphyrins that fluoresce bright red in UV light. Urine turns dark on standing in light.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The principal treatments of porphyria are protection from UV light and reduction of iron by phlebotomy or subcutaneous deferoxamine. No specific ocular treatment is available, although artificial tears may help wash away porphyrins. Corneal thinning and perforation are treated in standard ways.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In the sphingolipidoses, the cornea exhibits distinctive changes consisting of whorl-&#173;like lines <span class="h5-text_italic">(cornea verticillata)</span> that originate in the basal layer of the epithelium and are located at the inferior central cornea (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 10-8">Fig&#160;10-8</span>; also see <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>, <span class="h5-text_xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-24</span>). The corneal changes resemble &#173;those noted in patients &#173;after long-&#173;term oral chloroquine or amiodarone therapy or &#173;after use of topical Rho kinase inhibitors or nitric oxide for treatment of glaucoma. In Tay-&#173;Sachs disease, the corneal endothelial cells can appear distended and filled with single membrane-&#173;bound vacuoles.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Periorbital edema occurs in 25% of cases, posterior spokelike cataracts are seen in 50%, and conjunctival aneurysms occur in 60%. Other ocular signs include papilledema, ret&#173;i&#173;nal or macular edema, optic atrophy, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular dilation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Although most sphingolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, Fabry disease is inherited in an X-&#173;linked manner. Hemizygous males with X-&#173;linked Fabry disease are more seriously affected than heterozygous females and show the typical corneal changes. Fabry disease is also characterized by renal failure, peripheral neuropathy with painful dysesthesias in the lower extremities, and skin lesions (angiokeratomas). The skin lesions are small, round, vascular eruptions that &#173;later become hyperkeratotic. They consist of an accumulation of sphingolipid within the vascular endothelium.</p>

					<p class="h2">Mucolipidoses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mucolipidoses (MLs) are inherited disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism combined. They are autosomal recessive conditions and have features common to both MPSs and lipidoses. The 4 currently recognized diseases in this class are summarized in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 10-6">&#173;Table&#160;10-6 and are as follows:</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">ML I (dysmorphic sialidosis)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">ML II (inclusion cell disease)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">ML III (pseudo-&#173;Hurler polydystrophy)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">ML IV</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> All of the MLs are characterized by varying degrees of corneal clouding, which is often progressive. A ret&#173;i&#173;nal cherry-&#173;red spot and ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration are also associated with many of &#173;these disorders.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> All MLs are caused by a defect in lysosomal acid hydrolase enzymes. As a result, incompletely degraded GAGs accumulate in the cornea and viscera, and sphingolipids are deposited in the &#173;retina and central &#173;nervous system. Histologic examination of corneal scrapings has revealed the accumulation of intracytoplasmic storage material in the corneal epithelium. The ML IV gene <span class="italic">(MCOLN1),</span> which encodes the protein mucolipin-1, has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 19.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> In affected patients, plasma cells are vacuolated, and levels of plasma lysosomal hydrolases are elevated. In ML IV, in which corneal clouding is pre&#173;sent from birth, conjunctival biopsy shows intralysosomal inclusion bodies that are</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">single membrane–&#173;limited cytoplasmic vacuoles containing both fibrillogranular and membranous lamellar materials</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">lamellar and concentric bodies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">&#173;There is no evidence of mucopolysacchariduria or cellular metachromasia.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Both PK and LK have been associated with generally poor results &#173;because resurfacing is impaired by the abnormal epithelial cells. Allograft limbal stem cell transplantation may be an option.</p>
					<p class="h2">Oligosaccharidoses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Oligosaccharidoses are lysosomal storage diseases caused by enzyme defects that result in oligosaccharide accumulation. Although fucosidosis and mannosidosis are differentiated by their enzyme deficiencies, both entities produce corneal clouding.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Fucosidosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by pathogenic variants in the <span class="italic">FUCA1</span> gene, which result in reduced activity of the <span class="greek">α</span>-&#173;<span class="smallcaps">l</span>-&#173;fucosidase enzyme. Histologic studies have revealed that even when the cornea appears clinically normal in patients with fucosidosis, corneal endothelial cells show the presence of cytoplasmic, membrane-&#173;bound, confluent areas of fibrillar, granular, and multilaminated deposits. Mannosidosis, also an autosomal recessive disorder, commonly pre&#173;sents with spokelike posterior cortical cataracts. Mannosidosis is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme mannosidase.</p>
					<p class="h2">Galactosialidosis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Galactosialidosis (Goldberg syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the <span class="italic">CTSA</span> gene (on chromosome 20), which encodes cathepsin A. The gene variants result in deficiencies of both neuraminidase (also called <span class="italic">sialidase</span>) and <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;galactosidase. Thus, the features of galactosialidosis are similar to &#173;those of lysosomal storage diseases resulting from <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;galactosidase or sialidase deficiency. Corneal clouding is typically mild; however, a cherry-&#173;red spot in the macula is a common finding.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Goldenhar-&#173;Gorlin syndrome, also known as <span class="italic">Goldenhar syndrome</span> and <span class="italic">oculoauriculovertebral spectrum,</span> is a rare congenital condition characterized by incomplete development of the ear, nose, soft palate, lip, and mandible. It is associated with anomalous development of the first and second branchial arches. See also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The most common corneal manifestation is a limbal dermoid (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 10-12">Fig&#160;10-12</span>). Other ocular findings include preauricular appendages (see Fig&#160;10-12C); colobomas of the eyelids, most commonly in the upper eyelid; and strabismus. Affected patients may have hemifacial microsomia (underdevelopment), hearing difficulties, and aural fistulae. In addition, scoliosis can develop secondary to incomplete development of the vertebrae. See &#173;Table&#160;10-8 for additional clinical findings.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Corneal dermoids</span> can occur in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently of Goldenhar-&#173;Gorlin syndrome. They are choristomas (ie, normal tissue in an aty&#173;pi&#173;cal location) and are composed of fibrous and fatty tissue and occasionally hair and sebaceous gland material. Limbal dermoids are covered by conjunctiva and often have an arcuslike deposition of lipid along their anterior corneal border. A dermoid can involve the entire cornea and even the entire anterior segment.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The cause of Goldenhar-&#173;Gorlin syndrome is uncertain, but it may have a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic component.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Corneal dermoids can be associated with amblyopia as a result of significant corneal astigmatism. As an affected child grows, the dermoid may enlarge, but it &#173;will have no malignant potential. The elevated portion of the dermoid can be surgically shaved down to improve cosmetic appearance, but the lesion often extends deep into the corneal and scleral tissues. Even &#173;after surgical debulking, corneal astigmatism may remain; however, use of a rigid contact lens or a mini scleral design lens can improve vision. LK can also improve the cosmetic appearance. Excision alone may result in significant scarring.</p>

It is estimated that 140 million &#173;children are vitamin A deficient worldwide. The earliest manifestation of visual impairment due to vitamin A deficiency is night blindness, or <span class="italic">nyctalopia</span>. At greatest risk are malnourished infants and babies born to vitamin A–&#173;deficient &#173;mothers. Concurrent corneal infections due to herpes simplex virus, measles virus, or bacteria predispose &#173;these &#173;children to keratomalacia and blindness. Although xerophthalmia usually results from low dietary intake of vitamin A, decreased absorption of vitamin A may also be responsible. In cases of vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia occurring in countries with a low rate of malnutrition, the condition is usually caused by unusual self-&#173;imposed dietary practices, chronic alcoholism, or lipid malabsorption (observed in cystic fibrosis, biliary cirrhosis, and bowel resection). The increase in gastric bypass surgical procedures has also led to a resurgence of vitamin A deficiency in developed countries.</p>

This spot consists of keratinized epithelium, inflammatory cells, debris, and <span class="h5-text_italic">Corynebacterium xerosis. Corynebacterium</span> bacilli metabolize the debris, producing the foamy appearance. Prolonged vitamin A deficiency may lead to corneal xerosis (abnormal dryness) with corneal ulceration and scarring and may eventually cause diffuse corneal necrosis or keratomalacia. The World Health &#173;Organization classifies the ocular surface changes of xerophthalmia (X) into 3 stages:</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;conjunctival xerosis, without (stage X1A) or with (stage X1B) Bit<span class="numbered-list_accent">ô</span>t spots</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Vitamin A deficiency &#173;causes blindness by inhibiting the production of rhodopsin. Xerosis of the conjunctiva and cornea due to vitamin A deficiency is associated with loss of mucus production by the goblet cells. The reduction in mucus destabilizes the tear film. Similar changes can occur in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> <span class="keypoint_underline">Systemic vitamin A deficiency, associated with keratomalacia, is a medical emergency with a mortality rate of 50% when left untreated.</span> Although administration of oral vitamin A &#173;will address the acute manifestations of keratomalacia, patients with this condition are usually affected by much broader protein-&#173;energy malnutrition and should be treated with both vitamin and protein-&#173;calorie supplements. Malabsorption may render oral administration in&#173;effec&#173;tive in patients with acute vitamin A deficiency; therefore, intramuscular injections may be required. Maintaining adequate corneal lubrication, preventing secondary infection, and protecting the cornea from keratolysis are essential steps in treating keratomalacia. More importantly, identifying and treating the under&#173;lying &#173;causes of vitamin A deficiency are vital to successful clinical management of the ocular complications.</p>

Similar opacities have been described in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, keratoconus, pre-&#173;Descemet corneal dystrophy, and other corneal dystrophies (see <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Nodular corneal degeneration and band keratopathy have been described. Secondary corneal changes such as vascularization and scarring from severe ectropion-&#173;related exposure can develop.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The goal of treatment in all ichthyosis disorders is to hydrate the skin and eyelids, remove scales, and slow the turnover of epidermis, when appropriate. &#173;These disorders are not responsive to corticosteroids.</p>
					<p class="h2">Ectodermal Dysplasia</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare hereditary condition that displays variable defects in the morphogenesis of ectodermal structures. It is a component of at least 150 distinct hereditary syndromes. Ectodermal dysplasia represents a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">presence of abnormalities at birth</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">nonprogressive course</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">diffuse involvement of the epidermis plus at least 1 of its appendages (hair, nails, teeth, sweat glands)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">vari&#173;ous inheritance patterns</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Many ocular abnormalities have been described in the ectodermal dysplasias, including sparse eyelashes and eyebrows, blepharitis, ankyloblepharon, hypoplastic lacrimal ducts, diminished tear production, abnormal meibomian glands, dry conjunctivae, pterygia, corneal scarring and neovascularization, cataract, and glaucoma. The ocular surface changes may be due to limbal stem cell deficiency. Although the dermatologic manifestations are nonprogressive, the corneal conditions can worsen with time.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The ocular surface changes and blepharitis can be managed with tear replacement and preservation, together with eyelid hygiene. Keratolimbal autograft transplantation in combination with PK may be considered.</p>
					<p class="h2">Xeroderma Pigmentosum</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by extreme skin photosensitivity resulting from an impaired ability to repair sunlight-&#173;induced damage to DNA.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, the sun-&#173;exposed skin develops areas of focal hyperpigmentation, atrophy, actinic keratosis, and telangiectasia during the first or second &#173;decade of life—as if the patient had received a heavy dose of radiation. &#173;Later, many cutaneous neoplasms appear; &#173;these include squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Corneal findings include exposure keratopathy, ulceration, neovascularization, scarring, and even perforation. Keratoconus and gelatinous droplike corneal dystrophy have also been reported. Ocular manifestations include photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, and signs and symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The conjunctiva can become dry and inflamed with telangiectasia and hyperpigmentation. Pingueculae and pterygia often occur. The eyelids can be involved, with progressive atrophy, madarosis, trichiasis, scarring, symblepharon, entropion, ectropion, and sometimes even loss of the entire lower eyelid. Ocular neoplasms occur in 11% of affected patients, most frequently at the limbus. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent histologic type, followed by basal cell carcinoma and melanoma.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Other dermatologic disorders that have ocular manifestations include seborrhea, staphylococcal hypersensitivity, rosacea, and atopic disease. The cornea may show marginal ulceration, neovascularization, and pannus formation. &#173;These topics are discussed in Chapter&#160;3.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Skin protection from UV radiation, including use of sunscreen and protective clothing, is the mainstay of therapy. In addition, patients with xeroderma pigmentosum should be monitored for skin and eyelid malignancies.</p>
