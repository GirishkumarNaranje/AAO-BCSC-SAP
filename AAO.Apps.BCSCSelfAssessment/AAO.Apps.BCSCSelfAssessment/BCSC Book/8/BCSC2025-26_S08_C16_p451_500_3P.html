If the donor is another person, the tissue is called an <span class="italic">allograft</span> and the procedure is referred to as <span class="italic">allogeneic transplantation.</span> If the donor tissue is from the same eye or fellow eye, it is called an <span class="italic">autograft</span> and the procedure is referred to as <span class="italic">autologous transplantation</span>.

					<p class="h2">Corneal Transplant Procedures and Trends in the United States</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Over the past 20&#160;years, &#173;there has been a dramatic shift in surgeon preference for corneal transplant procedures—&#173;from penetrating keratoplasty (PK; also, PKP) to lamellar keratoplasty. In 2000, 99.3% of US corneal transplant procedures &#173;were PKs. In 2012, endothelial keratoplasty (EK) surpassed PK. Among EK procedures, the proportion of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) surgeries steadily increased from 3% in 2012 to 49% in 2022, with Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) making up the remaining 51%. By 2022, the mix of keratoplasty procedures in the United States had evolved as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">65.4% EK, comprising<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list-mid _idGenParaOverride-1">51% DSEK</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list-mid _idGenParaOverride-1">49% DMEK</li></ul></li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">33.6% PK</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">1% anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALK), comprising deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) and anterior or midstromal ALK</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">0.2% keratoprosthesis (KPro; Mas&#173;sa&#173;chu&#173;setts Eye and Ear Infirmary)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">0.2% keratolimbal allograft</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">PK is still performed in 10% of endothelial dysfunction cases. Corneal stromal opacity or scarring due to prolonged edema or infection may explain this finding. In 2022, the leading indication for PK was regrafts, followed by keratoconus (eTable 16-1, available online at <a target="_blank" href="http://aao.org/bcscsupplement_section08">aao.&#173;org/&#173;bcscsupplement_&#173;section08</a>). <span class="keypoint_underline">The decreasing number of keratoplasties performed for keratoconus may be attributable to crosslinking and improved contact lenses.</span> In &#173;Europe, DALK is becoming more common, perhaps &#173;because tissue suitable for DALK is more readily available than tissue for PK. Other advantages of DALK include a visual outcome similar to that for PK without the risk of endothelial rejection or increased risk of intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage. <span class="keypoint_underline">By maintaining Descemet membrane, DALK has a reduced risk of traumatic ruptured globe, but direct trauma can still lead to wound dehiscence.</span> In the United States, the slower &#173;acceptance of DALK may be explained by the increased surgical time and skill required, the lower reimbursement, and the easy access to tissue suitable for PK.</p>

					<p class="h2-h1">Tissue Pro&#173;cessing and Preservation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eye banks in the United States typically preserve tissue at 2°–8°C in media that contain nutrients, dextran, and antibiotics such as Eusol-&#173;C (Alchimia), which contains gentamycin, or Optisol GS (Bausch <span class="symbol">+</span> Lomb) and KERASAVE (Alchimia), which contain streptomycin in addition to gentamycin. KERASAVE is supplied with separate amphotericin B tablets that may be dissolved in the solution prior to donor cornea insertion for antifungal activity. Tissue can remain &#173;viable for up to 2 weeks.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Eye banks in &#173;Europe typically incubate donor corneal tissue in organ culture storage at 37°C. Organ culture allows tissue to be stored for up to 35 days. However, it requires a microbiological examination at the end of the storage period to confirm sterility before the tissue is used, which can reduce the incidence of contaminated transplants. The organ culture system is also more complex, costly, and labor-&#173;intensive than intermediate storage at 4°C, but the longer storage time is advantageous in places where the supply of donor corneas is &#173;limited.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The &#173;process of tissue recovery and preparation includes a detailed donor history, a slit-&#173;lamp evaluation, and an endothelial cell count at the eye bank before release for transplantation. The optimal time from death to recovery is less than 12 hours, or up to 24 hours if the donor body has been refrigerated or ice has been placed over the eyes. Most eye banks prepare precut tissue for Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and prestripped tissue for DMEK, placing the letter “S” or other directional stamp on the anterior side to aid orientation. The option of preloaded tissue, particularly for DMEK, has become increasingly utilized.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Donor tissue from a person youn&#173;ger than 2&#160;years is typically not used for PK &#173;because it is extremely steep and difficult to &#173;handle, which poses challenges in creating a watertight closure and achieving a predictable refractive outcome. Corneas from donors who have under&#173;gone cataract surgery are acceptable if they exceed the minimum acceptable cell count outlined in the eye bank’s policy (typically 2000&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>). Corneas with low endothelial cell counts and clear stroma may be suitable for anterior lamellar procedures. Conversely, corneas with anterior stromal opacities but acceptable cell counts may be used for EK. Descemet peeled from a donor youn&#173;ger than 50&#160;years is thinner, tends to form a tighter scroll, and may be more difficult to unscroll during DMEK. However, a recent series involving tissue from donors youn&#173;ger than 50&#160;years versus &#173;those 50&#160;years and older reported comparable success with DMEK in both groups.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Results from 2 landmark studies of eye bank–&#173;supplied corneal tissue, the Cornea Donor Study (CDS) and the Cornea Preservation Time Study (CPTS), provide guidance for se&#173;lection of donor tissue. The CDS evaluated the effect of donor age on graft survival in patients with PK. Donors &#173;were grouped into 2 cohorts according to age: 10–64&#160;years and 65–75&#160;years. At 5-&#173;year follow-up, the study showed no difference in the rate of graft survival between the 2 groups. However, at 10-&#173;year follow-up, the rate of graft survival was slightly lower in patients who received tissue from donors older than 70&#160;years. The CPTS found that DSEK tissue preserved in Optisol GS or Life4°C (Duraent biologicals LTD) demonstrated comparable graft success rates for tissue stored up to 11 days &#173;after death and even up to 14 days in some circumstances.</p>

				<div id="Chapt16_Top4">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete ophthalmic evaluation, including a history (see text box) and examination, is necessary before considering corneal transplantation. It is impor&#173;tant to obtain a detailed social history to help determine &#173;whether the patient or caretakers can adhere to the potentially complex postoperative treatment regimen.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Examination begins with an assessment of vision and vision potential. When vision can be improved with a rigid contact lens and the patient is able to tolerate contact lens wear, the patient can be offered treatment with a rigid scleral or corneal contact lens rather than surgery. In patients with an opaque cornea, &#173;simple clinical tests such as checking color vision, light projection, entoptic phenomenon, and afferent pupillary defect (ie, reverse Marcus Gunn pupil) may reveal additional conditions contributing to visual disability. Before considering PK, DALK, ALK, or another corneal procedure, checking for reduced corneal sensation is impor&#173;tant.</p>

					</p>
					
					<p class="body-text">Preexisting external eye conditions that may compromise corneal transplant healing and maintenance should be identified and controlled or corrected, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, before surgery. Conditions that compromise the ocular surface include dry eye, corneal hypoesthesia, acne rosacea, blepharitis, lagophthalmos, trichiasis, and abnormalities of eyelid position and likely &#173;will require continued care even &#173;after surgery.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A careful slit-&#173;lamp examination is a critical step in the evaluation &#173;process. In some patients, extensive guttae alone (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-1">Fig&#160;16-1</span>) may cause enough reduction in vision or symptoms of glare to warrant surgery. Subtle stromal edema can be seen at the slit lamp and can be &#173;measured with ultrasonic pachymetry, Scheimpflug imaging, or anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-&#173;OCT). (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span> for a discussion of &#173;these tests.) Typically, corneal edema is worse in the morning and improves throughout the day. Diurnal fluctuation can be &#173;either documented by testing in the early morning and in the after&#173;noon or simulated by having patients close their eyes for 30 minutes followed by repeated pachymetry and a slit-&#173;lamp examination. The presence of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), large iris defects, cataract, prior vitrectomy, anterior chamber or iris-&#173;/scleral-&#173;fixated intraocular lens (IOL), unstable IOL, tube shunts, or vitreous in the anterior chamber may influence the surgical approach. For example, difficulty in unfolding the DMEK lamella or creating an efficient air/gas &#173;bubble can complicate EK surgery. <span class="keypoint_underline">The presence of active keratitis or uveitis at the time of surgery is associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications, such as graft rejection or failure, glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema.

					<p class="body-text">During the preoperative evaluation, it is impor&#173;tant to &#173;measure intraocular pressure (IOP). If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, hypotony or elevated IOP should be normalized before intraocular surgery is considered. Poorly controlled glaucoma reduces endothelial cell survival and increases the risk of graft failure. Postoperative corticosteroid use may also affect IOP.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Additional testing such as OCT imaging may help detect ret&#173;i&#173;nal prob&#173;lems such as macular edema (cystoid or diabetic), epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane, or age-&#173;related macular degeneration. If the media are completely opaque, B-&#173;scan ultrasonography can help rule out a ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment or mass lesion.</p>

					<p class="body-text">To educate the patient about the risks and benefits of corneal transplant surgery, the surgeon must understand potential intraoperative and postoperative complications, as well as postoperative management; &#173;these are discussed in the following subsections and are summarized in <span class="xref-table" id="Table 16-5">&#173;Table&#160;16-5</span>.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Typical surgical technique for PK is as follows. A Flieringa ring is secured on the eye to provide stability. The cornea is marked (usually centrally for an optical PK), and the donor tissue is prepared. The donor tissue graft is usually oversized by 0.25‒0.50&#160;mm compared with the host trephination. A vacuum trephine is used to remove host corneal tissue, which is typically 7.5–8.5&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter. Following entry through the cornea, the anterior chamber is filled with viscoelastic, and the cut is completed with curved corneal scissors. The full-&#173;thickness donor corneal graft is then sutured to the host cornea with interrupted and/or &#173;running 10-0 nylon sutures. The knots are rotated so they are buried into the corneal stroma. &#173;Until the donor tissue is sutured and sealed, the eye is open and the iris and lens or IOL may bulge. An implanted IOL may extrude with vitreous prolapse, and expulsive choroidal hemorrhage can occur. Care must be taken to prevent the patient from squeezing and creating posterior positive pressure in the eye.</p>

					<p class="h2">Postoperative Care and Complications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The long-&#173;term success of a PK procedure depends on appropriate postoperative management and conscientious patient adherence. Frequent office visits are necessary to facilitate rapid vision rehabilitation and early recognition of the many complications that can occur &#173;after PK. Routine postsurgical care includes short-&#173;term use of topical antibiotics and a prolonged, perhaps indefinite, course of topical corticosteroids.</p>
					<p class="body-text">According to a survey of members of the Cornea Society, prednisolone acetate 1% is the topical corticosteroid of choice for prophylaxis against graft rejection, with dexamethasone as another option. Difluprednate is usually reserved for eyes at high risk of rejection. Loteprednol or fluorometholone may be preferable for &#173;steroid responders or phakic eyes. In low-&#173;risk cases, the corticosteroid dosage is typically 4 times per day for 1‒3 months, tapered according to inflammation &#173;until it has been reduced to once per day. If no rejection episodes occur in the first 6 to 12 months, the patient can be switched from prednisolone 1% to fluorometholone 0.1% or loteprednol 0.2%, which reduces the risk of corticosteroid-&#173;related complications. <span class="keypoint_underline">In the phakic patient, corticosteroids may be tapered off or the patient maintained on one low-&#173;potency formulation and/or low-&#173;frequency dosing to minimize the risk of cataract. The pseudophakic or aphakic patient is typically kept on a once-&#173;daily corticosteroid regimen.</span> Patients using corticosteroids should be followed up for IOP elevation in&#173;def&#173;initely.</p>

					<p class="body-text">In patients at high risk for graft rejection, the use of vari&#173;ous immunosuppressive agents, including oral &#173;steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, has been reported, but &#173;these medi&#173;cations require very careful follow-up &#173;because of their narrow therapeutic index.

					<p class="h3">Primary donor failure (primary endothelial failure)</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a graft is edematous from the first postoperative day, with high pachymetry readings, and remains so without inflammatory signs, the reason may be a deficiency of donor endothelium (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-2">Fig&#160;16-2</span>). However, the cause of donor failure is not always clear. Most surgeons allow at least 4 weeks and up to 2 months for spontaneous resolution of edema before considering regrafting.</p>
					<p class="h3">Wound misalignment or leak</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At the end of a PK procedure, the wound is always checked carefully for aqueous leakage. A Seidel test can be helpful postoperatively in assessing wound integrity, particularly in patients with low IOP and a normal or shallow anterior chamber. Small wound leaks or suture track leaks without iris incarceration often close spontaneously. Taping the eyelids closed (patching), therapeutic contact lenses, and use of aqueous suppressants may facilitate a watertight seal. Resuturing is advised for leaks associated with a shallow anterior chamber and low IOP lasting longer than 3 days.</p>
					<p class="h3">Flat chamber or iris incarceration in the wound</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the IOP is low and &#173;there is a flat chamber or iris incarceration in the wound, it is best to reposit the iris, re-&#173;form the anterior chamber, and resuture the wound in the operating room. If the prob&#173;lem is not addressed promptly and appropriately, anterior synechiae may form, increasing the risk of graft rejection, glaucoma, or graft failure. Normal or high IOP with a shallow or flat anterior chamber may signify pupillary block or malignant glaucoma (aqueous misdirection). Initially, dilation of the pupil may help break the pupillary block; if this is not successful, other &#173;measures are required. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for discussion of pupillary block and malignant glaucoma.</p>
					<p class="h3">Endophthalmitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperative endophthalmitis may result from intraoperative contamination, contamination of the donor corneal button, or per&#173;sis&#173;tent wound leak with invasion of micro&#173;organisms. The incidence of endophthalmitis is considerably higher in PK patients than in cataract surgery patients, particularly if the vitreous is invaded or if the donor died of infection. Immunosuppressed patients with moderate to severe eyelid inflammation are also at greater risk for infection. Early recognition and aggressive intervention can save the eye and possibly preserve vision in some cases. Donor rim culture can be performed perioperatively to identify potential contaminants. A rim culture positive for fungus is associated with endophthalmitis in 3% of recipients, and in the case of a positive bacterial rim culture, the risk is 1%. When a rim culture is positive, close postoperative follow-up is recommended for both recipients of the same donor, as both can develop infection.

					<p class="h3">Per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defect</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Large epithelial defects are common &#173;after PK, but they generally heal within 7–14 days. &#173;After this time, irreversible scarring and ulceration may occur. Patients who have reduced corneal sensation or decreased blink rate before surgery are at increased risk of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects. It is impor&#173;tant to appropriately manage ocular surface disease that contributes to the nonhealing epithelial defect (eg, dry eye, exposure, acne rosacea, blepharitis, or abnormal eyelid position). Lubrication, punctal occlusion with plugs or cautery, taping the eyelids closed, or therapeutic &#173;bandage contact lenses represent the first line of treatment. In difficult cases, amniotic membrane graft and temporary or permanent lateral tarsorrhaphy may be helpful. In neurotrophic eyes, recombinant &#173;human nerve growth &#173;factor (cenegermin, Domp<span class="accent">é</span>) may be applied (see the sections on neurotrophic keratopathy and per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects in Chapter&#160;4 and tarsorrhaphy in Chapter&#160;5.) If &#173;these &#173;measures are not successful, the diagnosis of herpetic keratitis should be considered even if this was not the under&#173;lying reason for the graft; in &#173;these cases, oral antivirals can be used as a therapeutic trial.</p>
					<p class="h3">Elevated intraocular pressure</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">High IOP may occur at any time &#173;after PK.&#160;Thus, routine &#173;measurement of IOP and evaluation of the optic nerve head for cupping are impor&#173;tant parts of postoperative care. Often, the first clinical sign of elevated IOP is the loss of folds in Descemet membrane. IOP elevation early in the postoperative period can be due to pupillary block, malignant glaucoma, hemorrhage, or pigment blocking the trabecular meshwork. Elevated IOP starting within 1 month postoperatively may be due to a corticosteroid response. However, high IOP can also occur many months or even years &#173;after uncomplicated use of a topical corticosteroid. Reducing the dosing or changing to a weaker corticosteroid such as fluorometholone may alleviate the IOP. When glaucoma develops, aggressive treatment with appropriate topical medi&#173;cations, &#173;laser surgery, or other surgical intervention is indicated. Although uncommon, epithelial downgrowth or fibrous ingrowth can also cause postoperative pressure elevation. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for further discussion of &#173;these conditions<span class="italic">.</span></p>
					<p class="h3">Recurrence of primary disease</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial, fungal, viral, or amebic keratitis can recur in a graft in the early postoperative period. Herpetic keratitis can recur at any time (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-3">Fig&#160;16-3</span>). In recurrent infections, medical treatment directed at the causative agent is the initial form of therapy (see Chapters&#160;11 and 12). With regard to topical corticosteroid use, management of infection must be balanced against the risk of rejection. Typically, the frequency or potency of the corticosteroid is significantly reduced in an effort to control the infection. In the case of herpes simplex, fungal, or amebic disease, topical corticosteroids are likely to potentiate the infection. Epithelial–&#173;stromal dystrophies such as granular or lattice corneal dystrophy can recur in the superficial cornea up to a year or more &#173;after the initial procedure (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-4">Fig&#160;16-4</span>; also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Dystrophic recurrence in the superficial stroma can be treated with phototherapeutic keratectomy (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5)</span>.</p>
					<p class="h3">Suture-&#173;related prob&#173;lems</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperative prob&#173;lems related to sutures that may necessitate removal include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">excessive tightness, producing an irregular astigmatism</li>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Loose or broken sutures do not contribute to wound stability and should be removed as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble.</span><span class="keypoint_underline"> Thus, inspection of suture integrity is an impor&#173;tant part of the routine postoperative examination. Loose sutures usually stain with fluorescein &#173;because they have broken through the corneal epithelium. For this reason, the application of topical fluorescein is also essential during the examination. When a &#173;running suture has loosened, it should be removed in its entirety.</span> Decolorizing nylon sutures are a signal that the sutures may soon break. Retained intrastromal suture fragments may be left in place. Vascularization along the suture indicates that the wound is adequately healed in that area and that sutures may safely be removed. Vascularized sutures are also prone to loosening, however, and may increase the likelihood of graft rejection.</p>
					<p class="body-text">&#173;After the sutures have been removed, the refractive error or astigmatism may shift dramatically, so it is impor&#173;tant that the surgeon see the patient in 3–4 weeks to ensure wound stability and to recheck refraction. The shift may occur even when sutures are removed years &#173;after surgery. Sutures removed within the first few weeks of surgery may need to be replaced to avoid wound leak or marked astigmatism. In general, however, surgeons start removing sutures several months postoperatively &#173;either selectively according to astigmatism or entirely &#173;after more than 1 year.</p>
					<p class="h3">Microbial keratitis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following &#173;factors predispose the patient to infectious keratitis sometimes caused by unusual organisms:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">long-&#173;term use of topical corticosteroids</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">loss of corneal sensation &#173;after transplantation</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">uneven tear film</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">suture exposure or erosion</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Culture of the infiltrate and the exposed suture is recommended, and initiation of broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic therapy can help avoid graft failure. A peculiar form of keratitis, infectious crystalline keratopathy (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-7">Fig&#160;16-7</span>; also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>), is occasionally observed in grafts and other immunocompromised corneas. Branching colonies of organisms proliferate in the deep corneal stroma, creating a crystalline appearance, with minimal or no inflammatory response due to biofilm cover. Several bacteria and fungi have been implicated, but viridans streptococci are the most frequent causative organism.</p>
					<p class="h3">Late non–&#173;immune-&#173;mediated endothelial failure</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the absence of acute inflammation or graft rejection, visually significant corneal edema occurring months to years &#173;after the procedure may be due to the normal attrition of endothelial cells, which occurs at a rate 4 times greater in transplanted corneas than in nontransplanted corneas. (See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;2</span>, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Oph</span><span class="italic">thalmology,</span> for discussion of normal endothelial cell loss). In the Cornea Donor Study (CDS), median endothelial cell density had decreased by 70% over the first 5&#160;years following transplantation; by 10&#160;years, it had decreased by 76%. The CDS showed that the 10-&#173;year cumulative probability of non–&#173;immune-&#173;mediated graft failure was higher in patients treated for pseudophakic or aphakic corneal edema than in patients treated for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). The higher failure rate may be related to the placement of a poorly designed anterior chamber lens or improper placement of the lens during previous, complex cataract surgery. Such prob&#173;lems may require an IOL exchange at the time of PK. Patients with FECD may also have a higher peripheral endothelial reserve than pseudophakic or aphakic patients. In addition, patients with a prior diagnosis of glaucoma—&#173;especially &#173;those with a history of glaucoma surgery (particularly tube shunt surgery) and to a lesser extent, &#173;those taking glaucoma medi&#173;cations—&#173;face a higher probability of graft failure than do patients who have no history of glaucoma.</p>

					<p class="h3">Graft rejection</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal allograft rejection rarely occurs within the first month &#173;after PK; however, it may occur many years &#173;after the procedure. Large or eccentric grafts increase rejection rates due to exposure to corneal peripheral immune cells and conjunctival vasculature and lymphatics. Surgical techniques that avoid proximity to the peripheral cornea and early attention to loosening sutures and infections &#173;will minimize the risk of rejection.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-10"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Prompt recognition and treatment of rejection is critical, as ongoing endothelial rejection &#173;causes irretrievable endothelial cell loss.</p>
					<p class="body-text">At each visit, it is impor&#173;tant to review with the patient the symptoms of graft rejection, which may include pain, redness, photophobia, and decreased vision. Office staff can be trained in how to respond if a keratoplasty patient calls with &#173;these symptoms. If recognized early and treated aggressively with corticosteroids, most episodes of graft rejection do not cause irreversible graft failure.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Corneal transplant rejection &#173;after PK occurs in 4 distinct clinical forms, which may occur &#173;either singly or in combination.</span> (See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;9</span>, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span>)</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Epithelial rejection</span> The immune response may be directed entirely at the donor epithelium (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-8">Fig&#160;16-8</span>). Lymphocytes cause an elevated epithelial rejection line that advances centripetally. &#173;Because host cells replace lost donor epithelium, this form of rejection is problematic only in that in occasional cases it may herald the onset of endothelial rejection. Epithelial rejection occurs in a minority of patients experiencing rejection and is usually seen early in the postoperative period. It may be asymptomatic; however, blurred vision can occur if the epithelial ridge is near the visual axis. The donor epithelium is ultimately replaced by the host epithelium.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Subepithelial rejection</span> Corneal transplant rejection may also pre&#173;sent as subepithelial infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-9">Fig&#160;16-9</span>; in DALK, see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;16-13</span>). &#173;These may be asymptomatic or may cause glare or reduced vision. It is not known &#173;whether &#173;these lymphocytic cells are directed at donor keratocytes or at donor epithelial cells.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Easily missed on cursory examination, subepithelial infiltrates can best be seen with broad, oblique illumination. They resemble the infiltrates associated with adenoviral kera&#173;toconjunctivitis but are confined to the donor graft. Subepithelial graft rejection may completely resolve if treated, but not uncommonly it may presage the more severe endothelial graft rejection.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Stromal rejection</span> Isolated stromal rejection is not common &#173;after PK; it is seen more commonly &#173;after DALK. It may pre&#173;sent as stromal infiltrates or edema (see the section “Allograft rejection,” <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;16-14A</span>), deep stromal vascularization (see Fig&#160;16-14B), or noninfiltrative keratolysis within the graft–&#173;host interface that does not extend into the peripheral recipient stroma. In severe or prolonged episodes of stromal rejection, the cornea can become necrotic. Stromal rejection may be accompanied or followed by endothelial rejection and is treated in a similar fashion.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Endothelial rejection</span> The most common and serious form of graft rejection is endothelial rejection, &#173;because loss of a significant number of endothelial cells leads to graft failure. Inflammatory precipitates are seen on the endothelial surface in fine precipitates, in random clumps, or in linear form under&#173;lying or in some cases delineating the area of corneal edema (Khodadoust line; <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-10">Fig&#160;16-10; see also <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;16-29</span> for keratic precipitates in DSEK</span>). Inflammatory cells are usually pre&#173;sent in the anterior chamber as well, but anterior uveitis is generally mild. As endothelial function is lost, the corneal stroma thickens with the development of posterior folds, and microcystic or bullous epithelial edema can occur. Patients have symptoms related to inflammation and corneal edema, such as photophobia, redness, irritation, halos around lights, or fogginess of vision.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> <span class="keypoint_underline">The mainstay of therapy for corneal allograft rejection is frequent administration of corticosteroid eyedrops.</span> Prednisolone 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, or difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% eyedrops are used as often as &#173;every hour, depending on the severity of the episode. Close follow-up to monitor for increased IOP is recommended, especially with difluprednate. For &#173;steroid responders or recalcitrant rejections, topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03% twice per day may be beneficial and is likely more effective than topical cyclosporine drops 4 times per day. For eyes with active herpes simplex epithelial keratitis, oral corticosteroids can be considered, rather than topical corticosteroids. The patient can also be prescribed an oral and possibly a topical antiviral medi&#173;cation.</p>

					<p class="body-text">In cases of endothelial rejection with edema, systemic corticosteroids may be considered &#173;either orally (prednisone 60&#160;mg per day, tapered as the graft rejection responds) or intravenously (a 1-&#173;time dose of 125–500&#160;mg methylprednisolone), in addition to topical treatment. Periocular injection of triamcinolone acetonide 0.5&#160;cc of 40&#160;mg/mL or dexamethasone 0.5&#160;cc of 4&#160;mg/mL may be administered for severe rejection episodes or nonadherent patients.

					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Control of Postoperative Corneal Astigmatism and Refractive Error</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratoplasty success is &#173;measured by the achievement of corneal clarity and functional refractive outcome. Severe astigmatism may be associated with decreased vision, anisometropia, aniseikonia, image distortion, and monocular diplopia, rendering an other&#173;wise clear graft poorly functional. In &#173;children, visually significant complications or astigmatism may lead to amblyopia.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Methods to reduce corneal astigmatism are listed in the text box on p. 474. Postoperatively, the primary method of reducing astigmatism is to re&#173;adjust or remove the sutures. However, in addition to suture manipulation, it is essential to optimize the condition of the ocular surface. If a single continuous suture has been placed, the surgeon may redistribute the suture tension at 1 month postoperatively, using corneal topography as a guide. Alternatively, if &#173;there is a combination of continuous and interrupted sutures, the interrupted sutures can be removed starting at 1 month (
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-11">Fig&#160;16-11</span>

					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-15"></span>
					<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-29"></span>
					). If the patient has only interrupted sutures, suture removal should begin at a &#173;later stage (eg, <span class="symbol">≥</span>3 months) to avoid wound disruption. Clinicians must be cognizant of the slower wound healing in older patients receiving long-&#173;term topical corticosteroid therapy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Prior to removal of the sutures, the most critical step is to identify the steep axis of astigmatism. Tight sutures, while causing focal flattening, &#173;will induce central steepening in the axis of the suture. The use of corneal topography, tomography, photokeratoscopy, or manual keratometry (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>) is essential for evaluating the corneal contour. A power map may show an asymmetric bow tie oriented in the steep axis, whereas an anterior elevation map &#173;will typically show focal depression in the area of a tight suture (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;16-11).</span> <span class="italic">Manifest refraction</span> can aid in confirming the steep axis (plus cylinder). &#173;After manipulation or removal of the sutures, a topical antibiotic is usually prescribed for several days with a return visit for repeated corneal topography and manifest refraction.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In eyes with good vision and low astigmatism, sutures may be left, but the patient should be informed about the possibility of late suture break.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The patient can be fitted with a scleral or corneal rigid gas-&#173;permeable contact lens to improve symptoms related to anisometropia and high or irregular astigmatism. Corneal neovascularization associated with contact lens wear is less likely to occur or pro&#173;gress once all sutures have been removed. The optimal time for contact lens vision rehabilitation is &#173;after suture removal, once topography is stable (usually within several months of final suture removal).</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Relaxing keratotomy,</span> performed with a metal or diamond knife or a femtosecond &#173;laser, can be effective in reducing astigmatism in patients with poorly tolerated astigmatism following complete suture removal. The arcuate incisions are placed &#173;either in the donor cornea central to the graft–&#173;host junction or in the graft–&#173;host interface at the steep (plus cylinder) meridian. Suture placement at the flat meridian can augment the effect. &#173;Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) have also been used to manage residual anisometropia and astigmatism &#173;after transplantation (see BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery</span>).</p>

				<div id="Chapt16_Top6">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With advances in surgical instruments and techniques, cornea surgeons are now able to selectively remove the diseased or scarred part of the cornea, preserving the healthy part. The &#173;process of removing and replacing select layers of the cornea is called <span class="italic">lamellar keratoplasty (LK).</span> The general ophthalmologist should be familiar with the indications, limitations, and common complications associated with vari&#173;ous types of lamellar surgery, including ALK, DALK, DSEK, and DMEK (see <span class="xref-table" id="Table 16-5">&#173;Table&#160;16-5</span>).</p>
					<p class="h2">Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty and Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty</p>
					<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3-h2_italic">Anterior lamellar keratoplasty</span></p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior lamellar keratoplasty is the first-&#173;line corneal transplant procedure when the pathology does not involve the endothelium. The abnormal stroma is replaced with partial-&#173;thickness donor tissue, retaining the healthy host tissue. When the graft involves the central cornea, the best visual outcome is achieved by removing as much stroma as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. ALK is performed for conditions such as keratoconus, postrefractive corneal ectasia, pellucid marginal degeneration, Terrien marginal degeneration, descemetocele formation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-12">Fig&#160;16-12</span>), superficial corneal tumors or scars, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis with significant keratolysis. See &#173;Table&#160;16-5 for additional information.</p>
					<p class="body-text">ALK can be performed manually or it can be microkeratome assisted or femtosecond &#173;laser assisted. When ALK is performed manually, a partial-&#173;thickness trephination is performed followed by blunt lamellar dissection to the desired depth. A partial-&#173;thickness, matched corneal donor tissue is then trephined and sutured. This technique can be performed eccentrically for corneal thinning &#173;after tumor excision or corneal melting. (Also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>, Fig&#160;13-25). When a microkeratome is used, a superficial &#173;free lamella is cut from the recipient eye. The donor cornea is mounted on an artificial anterior chamber, and a lamella of the same thickness is prepared using the microkeratome. The donor lamella is trephined to match the size of the recipient bed and is then sutured. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span> for a demonstration of this technique during the insertion of a tattoo pigment in a blind eye for cosmetic appearance (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>, Fig&#160;5-17; Video&#160;5-13). A similar procedure can be performed using a femtosecond &#173;laser. The depth of the stromal lenticule can be set according to the depth of the scar, &#173;measured by AS-&#173;OCT.</p>

					<p class="h3">Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty is a version of ALK in which full-&#173;depth (or close to full-&#173;depth) host stromal replacement is achieved. DALK has become the ALK procedure of choice since the advent of surgical advances such as the big &#173;bubble technique, particularly for central or paracentral pathology. The goal in DALK is to remove at least 85% of the stroma, ideally with complete stromal removal facilitated by creating a cleavage plane at Descemet membrane. In comparison to &#173;limited stromal removal, DALK provides a more uniform depth dissection and a smoother lamellar interface, which in turn leads to better postoperative vision.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Full-&#173;depth stromal removal is referred to as <span class="italic">DALK.</span> When stromal dissection is deep but not complete, it is called <span class="italic">pre-&#173;Descemetic DALK.</span> In an OCT study of patients who underwent DALK, 20&#160;µm of residual stromal bed was not visually significant; however, 80&#160;<span class="greek">µ</span>m of residual tissue was associated with a reduction in vision. &#173;There are many techniques for dissecting stromal tissue to expose Descemet membrane, including the Anwar big &#173;bubble technique, the Melles technique, and the use of the femtosecond &#173;laser.

					<p class="body-text">In the big &#173;bubble technique, air is injected into the stroma to create a cavity and separate the stroma from Descemet membrane. Two types of big &#173;bubble formation have been described. The type created depends on the location of Dua layer following air injection. Dua layer is a compact, tough posterior stromal collagen layer 6‒15&#160;µm in thickness, just anterior to Descemet membrane, that contains few keratocytes and is relatively impervious to air injection. A type I &#173;bubble is formed by cleavage between the overlying stroma and Dua layer attached to Descemet membrane. A type II &#173;bubble occurs when Dua layer is separated from under&#173;lying Descemet membrane. Type II &#173;bubbles are less common than type I but are much more delicate and prone to perforation. They are typically recognized by their increased transparency and tendency to extend beyond the central 8&#160;mm of the cornea. Mixed, or hybrid, type I and II &#173;bubbles can also occur; like type II &#173;bubbles, they require extreme caution to avoid perforation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Even for experienced surgeons, it may not always be pos&#173;si&#173;ble to expose Descemet membrane using &#173;these techniques. In such cases, manual dissection is generally preferable to PK, but it poses a risk of reduced best-&#173;corrected visual acuity due to incomplete removal of the host stromal tissue and secondary interface haze. &#173;After recipient stromal removal, a full-&#173;thickness donor cornea is trephined, and Descemet membrane is removed. Suturing of the donor cornea to the recipient bed is performed with interrupted and/or &#173;running nylon 10-0 sutures (see Videos 16-3 through 16-5). Suture removal considerations and timing are similar to &#173;those of PK.</p>

					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Disadvantages</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior lamellar keratoplasty does not replace damaged endothelium. Also, the procedure is more technically demanding and time-&#173;consuming than PK. It may be associated with &#173;irregular or significant regular astigmatism and with opacification and vascularization of the graft–&#173;host interface. Stromal rejection is still pos&#173;si&#173;ble with ALK and may be problematic.</p>
					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Complications</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Allograft rejection</span> &#173;Because the corneal endothelium is not replaced, endothelial rejection cannot take place; however, epithelial rejection, subepithelial infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-13">Fig&#160;16-13</span>), and stromal rejection can still occur. Fortunately, corticosteroid therapy can be effective in &#173;these situations. Stromal rejection, characterized by significant edema and deep vascularization, can lead to corneal opacification and is more common &#173;after DALK and ALK than &#173;after PK (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-14">Fig&#160;16-14</span>).</p>
					<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-16"><span class="h4-head">Opacification and vascularization of the interface</span> Meticulous dissection of the lamellar plane during ALK is essential for the creation of a smooth, clear interface. Irrigation and cleaning of the lamellar bed at the time of surgery reduce the likelihood of postoperative opacification. Retained interface debris, secondary vascularization, microbial infections, or Descemet membrane wrinkling can reduce vision or prolong vision rehabilitation. Neovascularization can increase the risk of lipid keratopathy, leading to further corneal opacification.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Rupture of Descemet membrane</span> If the rupture is small, the procedure can usually be completed but may result in Descemet detachment. If &#173;there is a large perforation, conversion to PK may be necessary.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Double anterior chamber or Descemet detachment</span> Double (pseudo-) anterior chamber or Descemet detachment can occur &#173;because of fluid in the interface, which results from a Descemet membrane perforation or retained viscoelastic material. Injection of intracameral air can facilitate reattachment.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Additional complications associated with ALK</span> Just as in PK, patients who have under&#173;gone ALK can experience high and/or irregular corneal astigmatism, prolonged healing due to ocular surface disease, suture erosion (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-15">Fig&#160;16-15</span>) and abscess, infectious keratitis, neovascularization, graft rejection, and graft failure. In contrast to PK, endophthalmitis and PAS formation are rare.</p>

			<p class="h1">Endothelial Keratoplasty</p>
				<div id="Chapt16_Top7">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 1998, Melles introduced the concept of posterior lamellar surgery for endothelial dysfunction through a procedure called deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK). Melles modified the technique to include stripping of the host Descemet membrane and endothelium (descemetorhexis) and insertion of a hand-&#173;dissected posterior lamellar donor button, which was positioned against the host bed with an air &#173;bubble in the anterior chamber; the revised technique is known as Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK). Gorovoy &#173;later automated the lamellar dissection of the donor tissue by using a microkeratome, giving rise to Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Over time, the term DSEK has been &#173;adopted for &#173;these automated procedures; in this book, the term <span class="italic">DSEK</span> is similarly used.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Melles further modified the DSEK procedure by using only donor Descemet membrane and endothelium in a procedure termed Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). Further innovations in the technique used to insert and unscroll the tissue, the adoption of an “S” or another directional stamp for graft orientation, and the use of sulfur hex&#173;a&#173;fluor&#173;ide (SF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>) gas to extend the duration of the gas &#173;bubble have substantially reduced the incidence of postoperative complications and increased the use and success of DMEK. In addition, the availability of eye bank–&#173;prepared, prestamped, and preloaded tissues for DSEK and DMEK has increased the safety and popularity of both procedures.</p>

					<span class="xref-table" id="Table 16-5"></span>
					<span class="xref-table" id="Table 16-6">&#173;Table&#160;16-6</span> shows the increased use of DSEK and DMEK in the United States since 2016; EK use surpassed PK use in 2012. Videos 16-6 through 16-12 show the DSEK and DMEK procedures. In &#173;these procedures, the host Descemet membrane is peeled and a strip with a dia&#173;meter 0.5&#160;mm larger than the intended EK is removed (usually 8.5–9&#160;mm of stripping for an 8–8.5-mm graft). To reduce the risk of pupillary block, an inferior iridectomy can be performed. In DSEK, the corneal lamella is inserted through an incision using an inserter, glide, or forceps or by pulling with intraocular forceps through an opposite paracentesis. In DMEK, the folded double-&#173;scroll Descemet graft is injected through a small incision. It is unrolled by tapping on the cornea and flattening the anterior chamber to keep it open. &#173;After centering, the graft is attached to the posterior surface of the cornea by injecting air or gas under&#173;neath the implanted tissue. In vitrectomized eyes, shallowing the anterior chamber is difficult and the unfolding of the DMEK graft is challenging. About an hour postoperatively, the patient can be examined for signs of pupillary block and elevated IOP. If required, excessive air or gas can be evacuated via a paracentesis at the slit lamp (see the section&#160;Postoperative Care and Complications).

					<p class="h2">Advantages</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because EK involves inserting the donor tissue through a small corneal or scleral incision rather than through a large full-&#173;thickness incision as in PK, it has many advantages, including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">preservation of the structural integrity of the eye, with less risk of ocular injury &#173;after trauma to the eye (<span class="bullet-list_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 16-16">Fig&#160;16-16</span>)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">reduced incidence of graft rejection &#173;because less tissue is transplanted</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">reduction in suture-&#173;related prob&#173;lems</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">preservation of corneal sensation with less ocular surface disruption</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">less induced regular and irregular astigmatism</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">greater accuracy in IOL power calculations</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-21">more rapid vision rehabilitation</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h2">Disadvantages</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following are some of the main disadvantages of EK:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">increased risk of primary graft failure due to excess intraoperative manipulation or incorrect orientation (however, the “S” or other unidirectional stamp has reduced orientation issues)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">risk of pupillary block due to excessive air or gas</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">need for surgical interventions postoperatively, such as rebubbling</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">need for supine positioning postoperatively</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-21">tissue wasted during preparation (although the waste is minimized with eye bank–&#173;prepared tissue)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h3">Potential for reduced postoperative visual acuity</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Concomitant corneal pathology such as basement membrane changes or subepithelial &#173;fibrosis may cause surface irregularity that affects postoperative vision &#173;after EK. In some cases, debridement or superficial keratectomy may be beneficial. Preexisting long-&#173;standing corneal edema can also cause decreased vision &#173;after EK due to light scattering. A prospective evaluation of patients with FECD who underwent DSEK revealed that the corneal light scattering associated with anterior stromal haze progressively improved throughout the 5-&#173;year follow-up period, suggesting an ongoing corneal remodeling &#173;process. Best spectacle-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) also continued to improve each year, with 56% of eyes at 20/25 and 20% of eyes at 20/20 5&#160;years postoperatively.</p>
					<p class="body-text">&#173;After DMEK, visual acuity reaches its maximum potential by 6 months. On average, patients who have under&#173;gone DMEK see 1 Snellen line better than do DSEK patients, with 50% of DMEK eyes at 20/20 &#173;after 1 year. The difference in visual outcome between DSEK and DMEK eyes may be related to interface irregularities and alteration of the posterior corneal curvature that occurs with DSEK. In contrast, a nearly normal anatomical restoration of the cornea is achieved with DMEK, which is due to the extremely thin graft tissue used and the exceedingly smooth interface created.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Nevertheless, some surgeons prefer DSEK for routine EK &#173;because manipulation and placement of tissue are easier. DSEK is particularly useful in patients with disor&#173;ga&#173;nized anterior segments or with anterior chamber IOLs and in patients who have under&#173;gone vitrectomy or tube shunt surgery or other glaucoma procedure in which DMEK lamella is more difficult to unfold and attach. Some surgeons advocate using thinner donor grafts (between 50 and 120&#160;µm) to improve visual outcomes &#173;after DSEK (a variation called <span class="italic">ultrathin DSEK</span>)<span class="italic">.</span> Although a meta-&#173;analysis of 23 series found that &#173;there may be a weak correlation, overall, the evidence was insufficient to conclude that graft thickness is clinically impor&#173;tant with re&#173;spect to BCVA &#173;after DSEK. More recently described nanothin (<span class="symbol">≤</span>50&#160;µm) DSEK grafts have yielded vision and complication rates comparable to &#173;those of DMEK.</p>

					<p class="h2">Intraoperative Complications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications that can occur during DSEK or DMEK include improper orientation during placement of the donor tissue; graft failure due to excessive manipulation of the donor tissue, tearing of the donor tissue, or retention of viscoelastic in the interface; and vitreous or blood in the interface (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-17">Fig&#160;16-17</span>). Vitreous can enter the anterior chamber in eyes that have under&#173;gone complicated cataract surgery, whereas bleeding can arise from the peripheral iridectomy and may impede lamellar unfolding. See &#173;Table&#160;16-5 for other intraoperative complications associated with EK. Intraoperative AS-&#173;OCT, if available, enables the surgeon to check the entire graft for adherence and may reduce the incidence of incomplete attachment intraoperatively (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-18">Fig&#160;16-18</span>).</p>
					<p class="h2">Postoperative Care and Complications</p>
					<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3-h2_italic">Dislocation or decentration of the donor graft</span></p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In DSEK and DMEK, the donor tissue should be well centered over the pupil, without fluid in the interface. To promote tissue adherence over the ensuing days, 40%–80% of the air or gas (20% SF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>) &#173;bubble injected intraoperatively is intended to remain on postoperative day 1 (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-19">Fig&#160;16-19</span>). The air &#173;bubble resorbs within 2–4 days, and SF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span> resorbs within 4–7 days. However, some surgeons remove the air on the day of surgery. See &#173;Table&#160;16-7 for dislocation rates for DSEK and DMEK.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">DSEK</span> Dislocation or decentration of the donor graft (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-20">Fig&#160;16-20</span>) typically occurs within the first 24 hours &#173;after DSEK. A soft eye due to preexisting tube shunt surgery or uncontrolled release of the air increases the likelihood of a decentered or dislocated graft. Retained viscoelastic or the presence of vitreous in the interface may also prevent proper adherence of the graft. If the graft remains attached on postoperative day 1, subsequent dislocation is unlikely, although inadvertent trauma or eye rubbing during the first week may displace the donor tissue. Wearing glasses or a shield to protect the eye is recommended, along with exercising caution during instillation of eyedrops.</p>
					<p class="body-text">It is still not clear how long the air &#173;bubble should be retained &#173;after DSEK; some surgeons remove the air completely on the day of surgery without an increased incidence of tissue dislocation. This raises the possibility that long-&#173;term retention of an air &#173;bubble is not necessary for graft adherence in DSEK. Also unclear are the role and length of time for supine positioning following surgery to promote and retain graft adherence. Most surgeons advocate supine positioning for at least 1 hour &#173;after surgery; some recommend up to 4 days in this position, at least part-&#173;time. Supine positioning may be more impor&#173;tant for DMEK than for DSEK &#173;because DSEK lamella has a stromal scaffold that reduces the possibility of late detachments.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">DMEK</span> In DMEK, the donor tissue is more delicate, and as a result, peripheral or central detachments are more common (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-21">Fig&#160;16-21</span>). Strategies to reduce DMEK graft detachment include the use of isoexpansile 20% SF<span class="h4-text_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span> gas, which resorbs more slowly than air, and inferior peripheral iridectomy, which can allow placement of a larger &#173;bubble with reduced concern of pupillary block glaucoma. For patients receiving anticoagulants the surgeon may consider performing a peripheral iridotomy with a YAG &#173;laser prior to EK surgery to minimize the risk of intraoperative bleeding.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">To identify and follow graft detachment, postoperative AS-&#173;OCT (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-22">Fig&#160;16-22</span>) can be used in addition to intraoperative AS-&#173;OCT (see Fig&#160;16-18).</span> Small peripheral detachments that do not involve the visual axis can be observed over several weeks to ensure &#173;there is no progression. They usually seal without adverse impact.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The surgeon may wish to consider rebubbling in the following situations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">the graft detachment extends into the visual axis</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">greater than one-&#173;third of the graft area is involved</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">rolled edges are pre&#173;sent (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-23">Fig&#160;16-23A</span>)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">In one study, significant reduction in endothelial cell counts was reported at 5-&#173;year follow-up in patients with clinically significant graft detachments that &#173;were managed without rebubbling; this reduction led to a higher rate of late graft failure. In some cases, permanent stromal haze developed secondary to chronic corneal edema, worsening the visual outcome &#173;after repeated DMEK. Thus, early rebubbling seems to be the best course in such cases (Fig&#160;16-23B). When rebubbling is necessary, it can be performed at the slit lamp (Video&#160;16-13).</p>

					<p class="body-text">If &#173;after 2 months the graft is attached but the cornea still has visually significant edema, repeated surgery is indicated before the development of chronic corneal edema, which can lead to bullous keratopathy, epithelial breakdown, and scarring or pos&#173;si&#173;ble secondary infection.

					<p class="h3">Pupillary block</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior pupillary block or iris bomb<span class="accent">é</span> may occur if the anterior chamber &#173;bubble migrates posteriorly, preventing aqueous flow through the pupil. A large &#173;bubble in the anterior chamber in the presence of a small pupil can also block the flow of aqueous through the pupil. <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-24">Figures&#160;16-24</span> and <span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-25">16-25</span> show pupillary block &#173;after DSEK and DMEK, respectively. The resultant acute rise in IOP results in pain and can exacerbate preexisting optic nerve damage. Pupillary block may also lead to iridocorneal adhesion, damaging the graft and increasing the risk of rejection. Pupil dilation and supine positioning may relieve the pupillary block; if this fails, some air should be removed. An inferior iridectomy performed prior to or at the time of the surgery reduces the likelihood of this scenario.</p>
					<p class="h3">Epithelial ingrowth</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epithelial ingrowth following EK is vis&#173;i&#173;ble as a gray-&#173;white deposit within the graft–&#173;host interface (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-26">Fig&#160;16-26</span>).

In a large series of cases, the majority of patients with epithelial ingrowth &#173;were simply observed and continued to see well without further intervention. In the aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases that resulted in graft failure, a second DSEK or PK produced a good outcome without recurrent ingrowth. This contrasts with the progressive and devastating course of intraocular epithelial downgrowth associated with intracapsular cataract extraction or full-&#173;thickness PK. <span class="keypoint_underline">Epithelial ingrowth can be similar in appearance to fungal or bacterial interface infection and left untreated, both conditions may lead to a progressive deterioration of vision, accompanied by anterior chamber inflammation and pain.</span></p>

					<p class="h3">Other interface pathology</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After&#160;EK, <span class="italic">infections</span> can occur in the graft–&#173;host interface as a result of pathogens passing through venting incisions, contaminated donor tissue, or bacteria from the ocular surface dragged into the eye during insertion. The incidence of postoperative fungal infections is considerably higher for EK than for PK. &#173;These infections have occurred primarily in eyes that have under&#173;gone DSEK, but &#173;there are case reports of infections &#173;after DMEK as well (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-27">Fig&#160;16-27</span>). It is also pos&#173;si&#173;ble that the infection risk is increased &#173;because of microbial growth, which is due to tissue warming that occurs during preparation of donor tissue for EK. Over the past 10&#160;years, the Eye Bank Association of Amer&#173;i&#173;ca has reported EK fungal infection rates ranging from 0.011% to 0.052%, peaking in 2013 and decreasing to 0.013% in 2018. Donor rims that are culture positive for fungus have predictive value. In the Cornea Preservation Time Study, the overall rate of positive donor rim fungal cultures was 1.9%, with postoperative recipient fungal infection occurring in 6.7%, similar to other recent studies. Using a double application of povidone-&#173;iodine during tissue procurement, before and &#173;after conjunctival peritomy, may help to reduce tissue contamination.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Textural interface opacity (TIO)</span> describes interface irregularity that results from retained viscoelastic or from the shearing of stromal fibrils during an irregular microkeratome donor preparation. Interface opacification may also occur &#173;because of retention of fibers, incomplete removal of Descemet membrane, and per&#173;sis&#173;tence of interface fluid. The opacity has 2 forms: elongated (a lacy honeycomb pattern of deposits with intervening clear zones) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-28">Fig&#160;16-28</span>) and punctate (small, discrete deposits). TIO may be associated with reduced vision, but it typically improves or dis&#173;appears completely over many months. &#173;There have been no reports of textural interface prob&#173;lems &#173;after DMEK; TIO has been reported only in DSEK. Meticulous removal of viscoelastic before graft insertion may reduce the risk of TIO.</p>

					<p class="h3">Progression of cataracts</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endothelial keratoplasty performed in a phakic eye may induce cataract progression, particularly in patients with shallower anterior chambers (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>3.0&#160;mm); therefore, EK with lens extraction has been recommended in patients older than 50&#160;years or in the presence of mild to moderate cataract. DSEK or DMEK combined with cataract extraction does not increase the risk of graft dislocation, endothelial cell loss, or other non–&#173;cataract-&#173;related complications. &#173;After combined surgeries, however, patients usually are a &#173;little more hyperopic than the intended target, and the surgeon should aim for slight myopia as a result. In edematous corneas, the keratometry may be inaccurate but may change once the edema has been relieved.</p>

					<p class="h3">Primary graft failure</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In published reports, primary graft failure rates (within 60 days) range from 0% to 29% (average 5%) for DSEK and from 2.2% to 8.0% for DMEK (see &#173;Table&#160;16-7). The lower rates prob&#173;ably reflect better surgical technique, which results in less tissue manipulation and a lower rate of graft dislocations and thus less endothelial trauma. In complicated cases, &#173;there is a higher chance of graft detachment and primary failure.</p>
					<p class="h3">Graft rejection</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical &#173;presentation of graft rejection in EK patients differs from that in PK patients. The classic endothelial rejection line of PK is not commonly seen; rather, multiple fine keratic precipitates scattered across the cornea are typically noted (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-29">Fig&#160;16-29</span>).</p>
					<p class="body-text">The incidence of corneal graft rejection following EK is lower than that &#173;after PK. In a prospective study of DSEK patients that &#173;were maintained on topical corticosteroids in&#173;def&#173;initely, the rejection rate was 2% &#173;after 5&#160;years in 51 eyes. The rate of graft rejection &#173;after DMEK is even lower than &#173;after DSEK.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The postoperative regimen for graft rejection &#173;after EK is similar to that &#173;after PK as described &#173;earlier, although corticosteroids can be tapered down faster in EK patients. <span class="keypoint_underline">Long-&#173;term prophylaxis with a topical corticosteroid used once daily, regardless of the strength, is impor&#173;tant in reducing the incidence of graft rejection.</span> In a prospective study of 400 DMEK eyes followed up for 24 months, rejection occurred in 6% of eyes &#173;after corticosteroids &#173;were discontinued at 1 year versus 0% of eyes continued on a daily corticosteroid eyedrop. However, it is impor&#173;tant to discuss with the patient the potential for elevated IOP, infection, and cataract with long-&#173;term corticosteroid use.</p>

				<div id="Chapt16_Top8">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For &#173;children undergoing corneal transplantation, visual prognosis has been enhanced by better understanding of the special prob&#173;lems associated with pediatric grafts, advances in preoperative diagnostic techniques and in surgical methods, and improved postoperative management. Furthermore, improvements in pediatric anesthesia and recognition of the risk of amblyopia have led to &#173;earlier surgical intervention. The success rate of pediatric corneal transplantation depends on the extent of coexisting ocular abnormalities. For example, one of the most common indications for pediatric keratoplasty is Peters anomaly (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>). For type 1 disease, characterized by iridocorneal adhesions without lenticular involvement, the survival rate for a clear graft was 83%–90% in one large series (mean follow-up time of 78 months), depending on the age of the patient at the time of surgery. In contrast, in another large series of patients with &#173;either type 1 or type 2 Peters anomaly, the outcomes &#173;were significantly worse: only 56% of grafts remained clear at 6 months, and 44% at 3&#160;years. This discrepancy was attributed to more severe anterior segment findings, characteristically including adhesions to the cornea by the iris and/or lens; corneal neovascularization; glaucoma; cataract; and corneal staphyloma. With more extensive surgery, the survival rate of the grafts decreased.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Selective lamellar surgery may be very beneficial for pediatric eyes. In a study of 105 unilateral keratoplasty procedures in patients aged 16&#160;years and youn&#173;ger, graft survival rates at 4-&#173;year follow-up ranged from 84% to 90%. For treatment of endothelial disease such as congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, EK has been reported to provide good outcomes.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Corneal grafting in &#173;children youn&#173;ger than 2&#160;years is associated with rapid neovascularization, especially along the sutures. As the wound heals, erosions may occur along the sutures, leading to eye rubbing, epithelial defects, mucus accumulation, and pos&#173;si&#173;ble infection. In infants, suture erosion can occur as early as 2 weeks postoperatively and necessitates urgent and frequent examination &#173;under anesthesia in the operating room to evaluate the transplant and facilitate suture removal. <span class="keypoint_underline">Removal of any loose or eroded sutures is critical to avoid rejection, which can be sudden and severe, especially in infants and young &#173;children.</span> Early fitting with a contact lens (as early as the time of PK) and ocular occlusive therapy may be necessary to prevent development of amblyopia in &#173;children.</p>

				<div id="Chapt16_Top9">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The greatest advantage of a corneal autograft is the elimination of allograft rejection. Clinical circumstances appropriate for autograft are uncommon, but an astute ophthalmologist who recognizes the potential for a successful autograft procedure can spare the patient the risks associated with long-&#173;term topical corticosteroid use and the need for lifelong vigilance against rejection.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">rotational autograft</span> can be used to reposition a localized corneal scar that involves the pupillary axis. By making an eccentric trephination and rotating the host corneal button before resuturing, the surgeon can place a paracentral zone of clear cornea in the pupillary axis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-32">Fig&#160;16-32</span>). The procedure is particularly useful in &#173;children, in whom the prognosis for PK due to rejection is poorer, and in locations where suitable tissue is scarce. It is impor&#173;tant that the graft–&#173;host junction not be too close to the visual axis, &#173;because image distortion and irregular astigmatism could result.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">contralateral autograft</span> is reserved for patients who have a corneal opacity in 1 eye with a favorable visual prognosis and a clear cornea in the opposite eye with coexisting severe dysfunction of the afferent system (eg, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, severe amblyopia). The clear host corneal button is removed and replaced with an allograft. The clear host button is then transplanted into the fellow eye. When an eye with a clear cornea is to be enucleated or eviscerated, the cornea can be used as a donor for keratoplasty in the fellow eye.</p>
				</div>
			
			<p class="h1">Keratoprosthesis</p>
				<div id="Chapt16_Top10">
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In some patients, corneal transplantation is associated with an extremely guarded prognosis &#173;because of a history of multiple graft failures or corneal neovascularization (aniridia) or associated ocular surface disease, such as chronic bilateral ocular surface disease from Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome or mucous membrane pemphigoid. &#173;These patients may be good candidates for a synthetic keratoprosthesis. High-&#173;risk patients can be divided into 2 groups: &#173;those with a good blink reflex and adequate tear function and &#173;those with significant conjunctival scarring, dry eye, and exposure. In the first group of patients, the Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) type I works well (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 16-33">Fig&#160;16-33</span>). For patients with end-&#173;stage dry eye disease, the Boston keratoprosthesis type II is an option. It requires a permanent tarsorrhaphy through which a small anterior optic of the type II model emerges. Other types of keratoprostheses for &#173;these high-&#173;risk patients are more &#173;popular in &#173;Europe and include the TKPro, which uses tibia bone tissue, and the osteo-&#173;odonto-&#173;keratoprosthesis, which uses dentine and alveolar bone tissue.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Some surgeons have expanded the indications for a keratoprosthesis to include the treatment of ocular trauma, advanced quiescent herpetic disease, and aniridia.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The visual prognosis for keratoprosthesis implantation has improved &#173;because of innovations in the design of keratoprostheses and improvements in postoperative management. <span class="keypoint_underline">The use of a soft contact lens and long-&#173;term prophylactic antibiotics has reduced the incidence of infection and necrosis around the keratoprosthesis.</span> A review of the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture on KPro results published by the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology revealed that a BSCVA of 20/200 or better occurred in 45%–89% of eyes, and a BSCVA of 20/40 or better occurred in 11%–39% of eyes &#173;after implantation. In a large multicenter study of 300 eyes followed for 17.1 <span class="symbol">±</span> 14.8 months &#173;after implantation of the KPro, &#173;there was significant improvement in vision, although only 6% of eyes had visual acuity of 20/60 or better. The retention rate with the KPro ranged from 65% to 100%. Loss of vision resulted from corneal melts due to exposure keratopathy, endophthalmitis, infectious keratitis, or corneal ulceration.</p>
