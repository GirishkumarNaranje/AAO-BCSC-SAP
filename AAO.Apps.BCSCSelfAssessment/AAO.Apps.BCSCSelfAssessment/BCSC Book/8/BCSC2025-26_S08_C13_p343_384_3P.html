						<p class="h2-h1 ParaOverride-4">Contact Dermatoblepharitis</p>
						<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Topical ophthalmic medi&#173;cations, cosmetics, and environmental substances can occasionally trigger a local allergic reaction. An immediate hypersensitivity immunoglobulin (Ig) E–&#173;mediated (type I) reaction typically occurs within minutes &#173;after exposure to an allergen. Ocular reactions are associated with itching, eyelid erythema and swelling, conjunctival hyperemia, and chemosis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-1">Fig&#160;13-1</span>). In rare cases, signs of systemic anaphylaxis may develop in the patient.</p>
						<p class="body-text">Lymphocyte-&#173;mediated delayed hypersensitivity (type IV) reactions typically begin 24–72 hours following instillation of the offending topical agent but may not occur &#173;until weeks or months of continual use. Patients are often sensitized by previous exposure to the offending drug or its preservative. An acute eczematous reaction develops with erythema, edema, and scaling of the eyelid (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-2">Fig&#160;13-2</span>). Sequelae of chronic contact blepharoconjunctivitis include hyperpigmentation, dermal scarring, and lower-&#173;eyelid ectropion. A papillary conjunctivitis associated with mucoid or mucopurulent discharge may develop. Inferior punctate epithelial erosions may be noted.</p>

							<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet ParaOverride-7">preservatives: benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment of hypersensitivity reactions requires the identification and discontinuation of the offending agent. The history usually provides the necessary clues, but sometimes a challenge test is necessary to confirm a suspicion. Such tests should never be done in patients with a known systemic allergy to a drug.</p>
						<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions</span> are initially managed by allergen avoidance or discontinuation of the causative agent. Adjunctive therapy may involve the use of cold compresses, artificial lubricants, topical antihistamines, and mast cell stabilizers. Topical vasoconstrictors, &#173;either alone or in combination with antihistamines, may provide acute symptomatic relief, but long-&#173;term use is not recommended.</p>
						<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Delayed hypersensitivity reactions</span> are also treated with allergen withdrawal. In severe cases, a several-&#173;day course of topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment (0.03%), or pimecrolimus cream (1.0%; off-&#173;label use) applied to the eyelids and periocular skin may speed resolution of eyelid and conjunctival inflammation.</p>
						<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Atopic Dermatitis</p>
						<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition in genet&#173;ically susceptible individuals that usually begins in infancy or childhood and may or may not involve the external eye. Patients report marked itching and eczematous lesions on the eyelids and other sites (eg, joint flexures in adolescents and adults, face and extensor surfaces in infants and young &#173;children) (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-3">Fig&#160;13-3</span>). Affected patients usually have a personal or &#173;family history of atopic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and aspirin hypersensitivity.</p>
						<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ocular findings</span> include periorbital darkening of the skin, exaggerated eyelid folds, meibomianitis, ectropion, and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. The appearance of the skin lesions varies depending on the age of the patient. Infants typically have an erythematous rash, &#173;children tend to have eczematous dermatitis with secondary lichenification from scratching, and adults have scaly patches with thickened and wrinkled dry skin.</p>

						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis involves a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and impaired cell-&#173;mediated immunity. In addition, &#173;there is an increase both in IgE hypersensitivity and in histamine release from mast cells and basophils.</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> It is impor&#173;tant to identify and minimize allergens in the environment and in foods whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble. In general, it is advisable to consult with an allergist. Moisturizing lotions, creams, and petrolatum gels can be useful for skin hydration. Skin lesions can be controlled with a topical corticosteroid cream or ointment, beginning with a mild agent (hydrocortisone 1.0%, desonide 0.05%) and progressing to a stronger agent (clobetasone butyrate 0.05%); however, long-&#173;term use of topical &#173;steroids is discouraged to avoid skin thinning. Tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1% for adults; 0.03% for children aged 2 to 15 years) and pimecrolimus cream 1.0% are effective for topical skin application and have fewer adverse effects than do topical &#173;steroids. Oral antipruritic agents such as antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers can alleviate itching but may exacerbate dry eye symptoms secondary to anticholinergic activity. Dupilumab, an inhibitor of interleukins 4 and 13, is an effective biologic treatment for atopic dermatitis. However, this treatment can induce mild to severe keratoconjunctivitis, blepharitis, and meibomian gland dysfunction and in severe cases may cause cicatrizing conjunctivitis. Treatment for dupilumab-&#173;associated blepharoconjunctivitis consists of topical and oral corticosteroids, lubrication, eyelid hygiene, and warm compresses. Topical ocular administration of immunomodulators such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (off-&#173;label use) can also be helpful.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> SAC and PAC are largely IgE-&#173;mediated hypersensitivity reactions. The allergen, which is typically airborne, enters the tear film and comes into contact with allergen-&#173;specific IgE bound to conjunctival mast cells. Degranulation of mast cells releases histamine and other inflammatory mediators that cause itching, vasodilation, and edema in the acute phase. Additional mediators signal recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils in late-&#173;phase disease. In a presensitized individual, the activation and degranulation of mast cells can be triggered within minutes of allergen exposure.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The diagnosis of SAC is generally made through a careful patient history combined with the clinical signs and symptoms. Skin testing with a panel of allergens may be helpful in directing treatment.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Efforts are first directed at avoidance or elimination of the allergen. <span class="keypoint_underline">Thorough cleaning or replacing carpets, linens, and bedding in the patient’s home can be effective in removing accumulated allergens, such as animal dander and dust mites.

					<p class="body-text">Artificial tears act as a physical barrier to protect the ocular surface and carry away allergens and other inflammatory mediators. Topical vasoconstrictors, alone or in combination with antihistamines, may provide acute symptom relief for redness. However, their use for more than 5–7 consecutive days may predispose the patient’s eyes to a rebound effect of vascular dilation and per&#173;sis&#173;tent redness. Topical mast cell–&#173;stabilizing agents are useful in treating SAC (<span class="xref-table" id="Table 13-1">&#173;Table&#160;13-1</span>). Oral antihistamines can provide symptom relief in the short term but may be associated with an increase in dry eye.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If the offending allergen has been identified by skin testing, desensitization injections (allergen-&#173;specific immunotherapy) can be beneficial. Certain topical NSAIDs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cases of ocular atopy, but their efficacy varies greatly. Moreover, reports of corneal perforations with the use of topical NSAIDs, especially the generic forms, suggest the need for careful monitoring. Topical corticosteroids are very effective in managing ocular allergy; however, they are typically reserved for cases unresponsive to other treatments and must be used with caution. If corticosteroids are prescribed, patients must be clearly informed of the associated risks and closely monitored for adverse effects.

					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis</p>
					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a seasonally recurring, bilateral inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva that occurs predominantly in &#173;children to young adults, with a 2:1 male predominance. Frequently, patients have a personal or &#173;family history of atopy that includes allergic rhinitis, asthma, or eczema. The disease may persist year-&#173;round in severe cases. Symptoms consist of itching, photophobia, blurred vision, and copious mucoid discharge. &#173;There are 2 forms of VKC:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">palpebral VKC,</span> which is associated with diffuse papillary hypertrophy that is usually more prominent on the palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva of the upper eyelid. Bulbar hyperemia and chemosis are typically pre&#173;sent. In more severe cases, &#173;giant papillae resembling cobblestones may develop on the upper tarsus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-4">Fig&#160;13-4</span>; also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>, Fig&#160;3-2).</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">limbal VKC,</span> which may develop alone or in association with palpebral VKC. The limbal conjunctiva has a thickened, gelatinous appearance, with opalescent spots called <span class="bullet-list_italic">Horner-&#173;Trantas dots,</span> which are aggregates of eosinophils and epithelial cells (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-5">Fig&#160;13-5</span>).</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Corneal changes observed in VKC include punctate epithelial erosions in the superior and central cornea and pannus formation in the superior cornea. In severe cases, peripheral corneal vascularization may develop. Oval-&#173;shaped noninfectious ulcers, called <span class="italic">shield ulcers,</span> may form in the superior or central cornea as a result of constant rubbing of superior tarsal &#173;giant papillae against the corneal epithelium, as well as secretion of cytotoxic agents (major basic protein and eosinophilic cationic protein) by eosinophils (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-6">Fig&#160;13-6</span>). The secreted proteins form a dense plaque on the denuded stroma, inhibiting epithelialization. In severe cases, stem cell deficiency may also occur. An association between VKC and keratoconus has been reported.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Both IgE-&#173;mediated and lymphocyte-&#173;mediated hypersensitivity reactions are involved. The conjunctival inflammatory infiltrate in VKC consists of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and monocytes.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Therapy is based on the severity of the patient’s symptoms and the ocular surface disease. <span class="h5-text_italic">Mild cases</span> are typically managed successfully with topical antihistamines. Environmental control may be helpful; home air-&#173;conditioning systems can filter and decrease exposure to the offending antigen. <span class="h5-text_italic">Mild to moderate disease</span> may be responsive to topical mast cell stabilizers; in patients with seasonal exacerbations, &#173;these drops are typically started in the month before symptoms usually begin. <span class="h5-text_italic">Year-&#173;round disease</span> may require long-&#173;term maintenance dosing.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Severe cases</span> may require the use of topical corticosteroids. &#173;Because of the possibility of corticosteroid-&#173;related complications from long-&#173;term administration, &#173;these agents are typically reserved for exacerbations that result in moderate to severe discomfort and/or decreased vision. If a topical &#173;steroid is used, fluorometholone may be preferred; the risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation is lower with this drug than with prednisolone, &#173;because the former does not penetrate well into the anterior chamber. During exacerbations, intermittent (pulse) therapy can be very effective. Topical corticosteroids can be used relatively frequently (eg, &#173;every 2 hours) for 5–7 days and then tapered for maintenance to 2 or 3 times daily during the allergy season. The use of corticosteroid ointment at bedtime may be effective. Whenever corticosteroids are prescribed, it is critical to inform the patient of the adverse effects of long-&#173;term topical corticosteroid use and emphasize the importance of close follow-up.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In cooperative patients with severe VKC, <span class="italic">supratarsal injection of corticosteroid</span> is an alternative to topical delivery. The supratarsal subconjunctival space is located superior to the upper border of the superior tarsus and is most easily reached by everting the upper eyelid. &#173;After application of topical anesthesia, a supratarsal injection of 0.5–1.0&#160;mL of &#173;either a relatively short-&#173;acting corticosteroid such as dexamethasone phosphate (4&#160;mg/mL) or a longer-&#173;acting corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide (40&#160;mg/mL) can be performed. Close monitoring of IOP is critical.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Steroid-&#173;sparing agents</span> have been shown to be effective. Topical cyclosporine 0.1% is approved for treatment of VKC; other concentrations can be used 2–4 times daily in an off-&#173;label fashion. Adverse effects of cyclosporine include punctate epithelial keratopathy and ocular surface irritation. Topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or 0.1% can be applied to the eyelid and/or conjunctival cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac once to twice daily (off-&#173;label use) to treat refractory cases of VKC. Systemic anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy with oral prednisone given in a pulsed fashion can be helpful and is reserved for the most severe cases. Collaboration with an allergist is recommended.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Nonhealing shield ulcers can be treated by peeling or wiping of the corneal plaque followed by topical &#173;steroid and antibiotic drops (<span class="xref-video">Video&#160;13-1</span>). A &#173;bandage contact lens may be applied. Use of an amniotic membrane graft has been reported in severe cases.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The immunopathology of AKC combines IgE-&#173;mediated and lymphocyte-&#173;mediated reactions. One or more manifestations of AKC develop in approximately one-&#173;third of patients with atopic dermatitis. Atopic individuals demonstrate depressed systemic cell-&#173;mediated immunity.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> AKC treatment involves allergen avoidance; cold compresses may also be of benefit. The use of pharmacotherapeutic agents similar to &#173;those used in the treatment of VKC is helpful. Just as in VKC, topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or 0.1% can be applied once to twice daily (off-&#173;label use), and topical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2.0% 2–4 times daily can assist in limiting the topical corticosteroid required to control the inflammation. Patients should be advised about the potential for ocular burning and itching with topical tacrolimus use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus may be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, although the absolute risk is low and long-&#173;term large-&#173;scale studies are lacking. It is impor&#173;tant to carefully monitor patients for infectious diseases that may warrant specific therapy, such as secondary staphylococcal infections and herpes simplex keratitis (see &#173;Chapters&#160;11 and 12).</p>
					<p class="body-text">In severe cases, the indications for systemic therapy include chronic ocular surface inflammation unresponsive to topical treatment, ocular discomfort, progressive cicatrization, and peripheral ulcerative keratopathy.

Patients pre&#173;sent with symptoms of ocular irritation and foreign-&#173;body sensation. The cardinal finding consists of yellowish, platelike masses that overlie 1 or more of the palpebral surfaces and are readily vis&#173;i&#173;ble with eversion of the eyelid. Ligneous conjunctivitis is generally bilateral and can affect individuals of all ages.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Ligneous conjunctivitis has been linked to severe plasminogen deficiency type 1 (hypoplasminogenemia), with decreased fibrinolysis as the primary defect. More than 12% of patients with ligneous conjunctivitis have severe hypoplasminogenemia. The ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defect in the plasminogen gene <span class="h5-text_italic">(PLG)</span> is located at band 6q26. The membranes are composed of fibrin, fibrin-&#173;bound tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), epithelial cells, and inflammatory cells that adhere to the conjunctival surface. In patients with hypoplasmino&#173;genemia, &#173;these fibrin-&#173;rich membranes may also develop on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, oropharynx, trachea, and urogenital tract. Latent and activated forms of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) have also been identified.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) overlap, and TEN are acute inflammatory, vesiculobullous reactions involving the skin and at least 2 mucous membranes. The conjunctiva and oropharynx are the tissues most frequently involved. In this chapter, the term <span class="italic">SJS–&#173;TEN</span> is used to refer collectively to SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, and TEN. The current nomenclature is based on the amount of skin involvement:</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Prodromal fever, arthralgia, malaise, and upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms develop first and are usually sudden in onset. Skin eruption follows within a few days, with a classic “target” lesion consisting of a red center surrounded by a pale ring and then a red ring. Maculopapular and bullous skin lesions are also common. The mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, and genitalia may be affected by bullous lesions with membrane or pseudomembrane formation. New lesions may appear over 4–6 weeks, with approximately 2-&#173;week cycles for each crop of lesions.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In the acute phase, ocular findings may range from conjunctival hyperemia and punctate keratopathy in more mild cases, to epithelial sloughing of the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid margin in severe cases (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-10">Fig&#160;13-10</span>). Patients are at risk of infection &#173;because of loss of the epithelial barrier.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Between 30% and 50% of patients with SJS–&#173;TEN develop long-&#173;term ocular complications, including ocular surface cicatrization with formation of conjunctival symblepharon and forniceal shortening (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-11">Fig&#160;13-11</span>), eyelid margin keratinization, eyelid malposition (lagophthalmos, entropion, ectropion), trichiasis, and dry eye.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Acute&#160;SJS–&#173;TEN is a medical emergency associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Management requires a team-&#173;based approach, similar to that used for thermal burn victims, and includes the critical care physician, anesthesiologist, burn surgeon, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist. The offending agent must be immediately discontinued. Systemic therapy is mainly supportive and is aimed at managing dehydration and superinfection. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory agents, or IV immunoglobulins remains equivocal.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In the acute phase of SJS–&#173;TEN, ocular therapy should be focused on lubrication, infection prophylaxis, and control of ocular surface inflammation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-12">Fig&#160;13-12</span>). Vigilant surveillance with daily examinations during the initial phase is necessary to monitor for early manifestations of ocular infection or epithelial defects.

					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-10"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Significant long-&#173;term benefit, including improved visual acuity outcome, has been demonstrated when amniotic membrane grafting is performed within the first 3 to 7 days of onset of SJS–&#173;TEN. Amniotic membrane should be applied when any epithelial defect of the cornea, conjunctiva, or eyelid margin is &#173;present. If &#173;there is involvement of the palpebral conjunctiva and/or eyelid margin, the entire ocular surface, including the eyelid margins, should be covered with amniotic membrane. Vari&#173;ous techniques can be used, and the procedure can be done in the operating room or at the bedside for patients who cannot be taken to the operating room immediately.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Management of <span class="italic">chronic</span> SJS–&#173;TEN is targeted at rehabilitation of visual function and treatment of the resultant dry eye and the mechanical abnormalities of the eyelids and eyelashes, which can cause ocular surface trauma and inflammation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Dry eye is a significant prob&#173;lem secondary to scarring of the ocular surface and damage to the meibomian and accessory lacrimal glands. Conjunctival scarring can also affect lacrimal gland function. Treatment of dry eye includes lubrication with preservative-&#173;free drops and ointments, punctal occlusion, and eyelid hygiene. Topical and systemic corticosteroids have been reported to help reduce active inflammation but must be used with caution. Depending on the extent of the chronic disease, other treatment options include debridement of keratin from eyelid margins, use of &#173;bandage contact lenses or scleral lenses, and mucous membrane grafting. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span> for discussion of dry eye.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In patients with chronic disease, <span class="italic">vision rehabilitation</span> is challenging and can be high risk. Scleral contact lenses may improve patient comfort and vision and help some patients avoid surgery. Surgical treatments are risky and are generally avoided &#173;unless &#173;there are no other options. Living donor or cadaveric limbal stem cell transplantation and cultivated oral and nasal mucosal epithelial transplantation have been performed but are less successful in cases of extreme dry eye. Penetrating keratoplasty is associated with an extremely poor prognosis in patients with chronic disease and is generally reserved for eyes with progressive thinning or perforation. In severe cases, favorable results have been achieved with a keratoprosthesis, but success may be &#173;limited in patients with severe dry eye. Unfortunately, many patients with chronic SJS–&#173;TEN are young and &#173;will experience lifelong ocular morbidity. Rehabilitation is hindered not only by sequelae of the acute disease, but also by ongoing, chronic immunopathology of the ocular surface.</p>

In many cases, the disease initially produces nonspecific symptoms with minimal overt physical findings, such as chronic red eye. Fine white linear opacities may appear on the palpebral conjunctiva, indicative of subepithelial fibrosis (see Fig&#160;13-13). Abnormal shortening of the inferior fornix warrants further evaluation. A subtle inferior symblepharon can be detected when the lower eyelid is pulled down while the patient looks up (see Fig&#160;13-15). Oral mucosal lesions may be a clue that can lead to early diagnosis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Recurrent attacks of conjunctival inflammation can lead to destruction of goblet cells and eventually obstruction of the lacrimal gland orifices. The resultant aqueous and mucous tear deficiency leads to keratinization of the conjunctiva. Entropion and trichiasis may develop as scarring progresses, leading to corneal abrasions, vascularization (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-17">Fig&#160;13-17</span>), additional scarring, ulceration, and epidermalization of the ocular surface. Corneal abrasions in &#173;these patients are emergencies and must be treated immediately to minimize progression to ulceration, perforation, scarring, and ankyloblepharon formation (see Fig&#160;13-16). Although the clinical course varies, progressive deterioration usually occurs in untreated cases. Remissions and exacerbations are common. Surgical intervention can incite further scarring but may be essential in the management of entropion and trichiasis.</p>

Punctal occlusion, which may have already resulted from cicatrization, can be useful in the management of any associated dry eye condition. &#173;Because patients with cicatrizing conjunctivitis have a higher rate of spontaneous extrusion of silicone punctal plugs, permanent punctal occlusion with cautery is often required.

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="keypoint_underline">Reactive arthritis (formerly called </span><span class="keypoint_underline_italic">Reiter syndrome</span><span class="keypoint_underline">) is a systemic disorder characterized by the classic triad of ocular (conjunctivitis/episcleritis, iridocyclitis, or keratitis), urethral, and joint inflammation.</span> </p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> The most common ocular finding in reactive arthritis is a bilateral papillary conjunctivitis with mucopurulent discharge, which has been reported in 30%–60% of patients. The conjunctivitis is self-&#173;limited, lasting for days to weeks. Some patients pre&#173;sent with episcleritis rather than conjunctivitis. Mild nongranulomatous anterior uveitis has been reported in 3%–12% of patients. Vari&#173;ous forms of keratitis—&#173;including diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, superficial or deep focal infiltrates, and superficial or deep vascularization—&#173;occur in rare cases. Reactive arthritis may be considered in any case of chronic, nonfollicular, mucopurulent conjunctivitis with negative culture results.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The joint inflammation is often highly asymmetric and involves a few joints (oligoarticular). &#173;These manifestations can appear si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously or separately, in any sequence. Less common manifestations include keratoderma blennorrhagicum (a scaling skin eruption, particularly on the palms and &#173;soles), circinate balanitis (inflammation of the head of the penis), aphthous stomatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy, pneumonitis, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Attacks are self-&#173;limited, lasting from 2 to several months, but they may recur periodically over the course of several years.</p>

					<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Thygeson superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) is characterized by recurrent episodes of tearing, foreign-&#173;body sensation, photophobia, and reduced vision. It affects &#173;children more commonly than older adults and is typically bilateral, although it may develop initially in 1 eye or may be markedly asymmetric in some cases. Symptoms may exceed the apparent signs.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The hallmark finding noted during exacerbations is multiple (up to 40, but as few as 2–3) slightly elevated corneal epithelial infiltrates that demonstrate irregular staining with fluorescein (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-20">Fig&#160;13-20</span>; also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>, Fig&#160;3-6B). The epithelial lesions are small, round or oval gray-&#173;white granular opacities associated with minimal or no conjunctival reaction, in contrast to infiltrates seen in adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. High-&#173;magnification examination reveals each opacity to be a cluster of multiple, smaller pinpoint opacities. A characteristic feature is the waxing and waning appearance of individual epithelial opacities, which change in location and number over time. The greatest density of &#173;these lesions is typically found in the central cornea. The raised punctate epithelial lesions often stain with &#173;rose bengal in addition to fluorescein. &#173;There is no conjunctival inflammatory reaction during exacerbations, but occasionally mild bulbar conjunctival hyperemia may be noted.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The etiology of SPK is unknown. Although many of the clinical features resemble &#173;those of a viral infection of the corneal epithelium, attempts to confirm viral particles by electron microscopy or culture have been unsuccessful. No inflammatory cells are evident. The rapid response of the lesions to corticosteroid therapy suggests that SPK is largely immunogenically derived.</p>

					<p class="body-text">A mild topical corticosteroid may be effective, &#173;because the lesions are quite responsive to corticosteroids.

Initial symptoms are pain, tearing, photophobia, and perilimbal injection. The inflammation may last for weeks if left untreated. Sectoral superior stromal inflammation and keratic precipitates are typically seen early in the disease course. As the disease progresses, deep stromal neovascularization develops. Eventually, the inflammation spreads centrally, and corneal opacification and edema may develop. In some cases, the deep corneal vascularization becomes so intense that the cornea appears salmon pink—&#173;hence the term <span class="italic">salmon patch</span> (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-21">Fig&#160;13-21</span>). Sequelae of stromal keratitis include corneal scarring, thickening of Descemet membrane, corneal thinning, and ghost vessels in the deep layers of the stroma. Vision may be reduced &#173;because of irregular astigmatism and stromal opacification.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Stromal keratitis is less common in acquired syphilis; if it occurs, it is unilateral in 60% of cases.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> During the acute phase, ocular inflammation is treated with topical corticosteroids in order to limit stromal inflammation and late scarring. Cycloplegic drugs can be helpful as well. If untreated, the disease can “burn out” over time, but &#173;because chronic disease can lead to severe corneal opacification, early intervention is beneficial in preventing the late sequelae noted previously. Patients with systemic syphilis or neuroret&#173;i&#173;nal manifestations should be treated with penicillin or an appropriate alternative antibiotic in accordance with the protocol for &#173;either congenital or acquired syphilis. The necessity of lumbar puncture in syphilitic IK is uncertain, and any patient with suspected syphilis should be referred to a specialist in infectious diseases.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Cogan syndrome is characterized by stromal keratitis, vertigo, and hearing loss and typically occurs in young adults. The history may reveal a recent upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, dental infection, or immunization. The earliest corneal findings are bilateral faint, white subepithelial infiltrates resembling &#173;those occurring in viral keratoconjunctivitis but located in the peripheral cornea. Multifocal nodular stromal infiltrates may develop weeks to months &#173;later. Although stromal keratitis is the typical &#173;presentation, ocular inflammation in Cogan syndrome may include conjunctivitis, anterior or posterior scleritis, iridocyclitis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, and papillitis. A systemic vasculitis resembling polyarteritis nodosa occurs in some patients.</p>

Other infectious syndromes should also be considered. Antibodies to chlamydia have been reported in cases of Cogan syndrome. A hearing test should be performed when Cogan syndrome is being considered; the presence of autoantibodies to inner ear and endothelial antigens has been reported. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-&#173;reactive protein (CRP) level may be elevated. Also, case reports have noted that affected patients test positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), rheumatoid &#173;factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anticardiolipin antibodies. However, laboratory findings are not consistent in Cogan syndrome, and &#173;there is no definitive test. This syndrome thus remains a diagnosis of exclusion.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Although autoimmune PUK can be bilateral and extensive, it is usually unilateral and &#173;limited to 1 sector of the peripheral cornea (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-22">Fig&#160;13-22</span>). The initial lesions appear in a zone within 2&#160;mm of the limbus and are accompanied by varying degrees of vaso-&#173;occlusion of the adjacent limbal vascular network. In most cases, the epithelium is absent, and the under&#173;lying stroma thinned in the affected area. However, if the disease is detected early, epithelial loss may be patchy and stromal loss kept to a minimum. Ulceration may be associated with a stromal infiltrate, and the adjacent conjunctiva can be minimally or severely inflamed. The sclera can also be involved in patients with systemic immune-&#173;mediated diseases (eg, necrotizing scleritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis).</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The limbus plays an impor&#173;tant role in immune-&#173;mediated corneal disorders. It has a population of antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs) that express major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and are capable of efficient mobilization and induction of T-&#173;cell responses. Immune-&#173;related corneal changes often occur in the periphery &#173;because this area is adjacent to the avascular limbus. The proximity of blood vessels permits circulating immune cells, immune complexes, and complement &#173;factors to deposit in the cornea adjacent to the terminal capillary loops of the limbal vascular arcades, thereby producing a variety of immune phenomena that manifest in the periphery.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Though not a standard diagnostic procedure, biopsy of conjunctival tissue adjacent to marginal corneal disease typically shows evidence of immune-&#173;mediated vaso-&#173;occlusive disease. In patients with systemic autoimmune disease, central or paracentral corneal melting that may pro&#173;gress to perforation can infrequently occur (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-23">Fig&#160;13-23</span>). The mechanism is not completely clear. Histopathologic studies have demonstrated T-&#173;lymphocyte infiltration.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The goal of therapy is to provide local supportive &#173;measures to decrease stromal melting. This is achieved through treatment intended to promote epithelialization, improve ocular surface lubrication, and suppress immune-&#173;mediated inflammation both locally and systemically.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Maintaining enhanced lubrication of the ocular surface is very impor&#173;tant, &#173;because dry eye is a manifestation of secondary Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome in many patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Autologous serum tears may be helpful if artificial tears are insufficient. Melting may stop or slow appreciably when epithelial healing is achieved by means of enhanced tear function, taping the eyelid closed (patching), or a &#173;bandage contact lens.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Collagenase inhibitors</span> (eg, topical sodium citrate 10%, acetylcysteine 20%, medroxyprogesterone 1%) and systemic collagenase and MMP-9 inhibitors (eg, doxycycline, minocycline) are of potential value. Topical cyclosporine has been shown to be effective in patients with central melting that is likely due to a T-&#173;cell–&#173;mediated &#173;process rather than occlusive vasculitis. In addition, vitamin C neutralizes oxygen &#173;free radicals and when given orally, it is thought to inhibit damage to adjacent epithelial and stromal tissues and promote healing of corneal ulcers.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Systemic corticosteroids</span> can help control the under&#173;lying disease and result in enhanced collagenase function. When considering topical corticosteroids, the clinician must weigh the benefits of treating inflammation against the risks of impaired healing, secondary infection, and potentiation of collagenase, which may increase the chance of stromal melt.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If inflammation is unresponsive to medical therapy, <span class="italic">excision</span> or <span class="italic">recession of adjacent limbal conjunctiva</span> may be performed, particularly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This is effective presumably &#173;because the procedure removes the adjacent source of inflammatory cells and collagenolytic enzymes.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When healing with local &#173;measures alone is inadequate, <span class="italic">systemic immunosuppression</span> is required. It is very impor&#173;tant to partner with a rheumatologist in caring for patients with immune-&#173;mediated disease &#173;because of their considerable risk of morbidity and death. Institution or escalation of systemic treatment, including immunosuppressive therapy with immunomodulatory agents (eg, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine) in addition to or in place of oral prednisone, may be helpful. Biologic agents such as infliximab have reportedly been used with some success in more severe cases. Patients with severe, rapid melting may require IV therapy with high-&#173;dose cyclophosphamide, with or without corticosteroid therapy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Impending perforation is treated with temporizing &#173;measures such as cyanoacrylate glue (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>, Video&#160;5-10) and &#173;bandage contact lens placement &#173;until systemic therapy can control the under&#173;lying disease. Lamellar and penetrating grafts are susceptible to melting if the under&#173;lying systemic disease has not been controlled. Sometimes multiple tectonic grafts are required to preserve the globe while the systemic therapy is being adjusted. Once the under&#173;lying disease &#173;process has been controlled, keratoplasty for vision restoration can be performed (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span>). Although conjunctival flaps can be very helpful in controlling the stromal melting in many situations, they are prob&#173;ably best avoided in patients with immune-&#173;mediated disease, &#173;because bringing the conjunctival vasculature even closer to the area of corneal disease could accelerate keratolysis.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Two clinical types of Mooren ulcer have been described. <span class="italic">Unilateral</span> Mooren ulcer is a slowly progressive disease that typically occurs in an older patient population and has an equal sex distribution. The second type of Mooren ulcer, which is more common in Africa, is usually bilateral, progresses rapidly, and responds poorly to medical or surgical intervention (see Fig&#160;13-24). Corneal ulceration frequently progresses to perforation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-25">Fig&#160;13-25</span>). Many patients with this form of Mooren ulcer have coexisting parasitemia. In this subgroup of West African men, Mooren ulcer may be triggered by antigen–&#173;antibody reaction to helminthic toxins or antigens deposited in the limbal cornea during the blood-&#173;borne phase of parasitic infection. In patients with Mooren ulcer–&#173;like findings, testing for hepatitis C should be considered, &#173;because &#173;there is increased prevalence of comorbid disease.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Although the cause of Mooren ulcer is unknown, precipitating &#173;factors include accidental trauma, ocular surgery, hepatitis C, or exposure to parasitic infection.

About one-&#173;half of scleritis cases are bilateral at some time in their course. The onset of scleritis is usually gradual, extending over several days. Most patients with scleritis experience severe, boring ocular pain, which may worsen at night and occasionally awakens them from sleep. The pain may be referred to other regions of the head or face on the involved side, and the globe is often tender. The inflamed sclera has a violaceous hue that is best seen in natu&#173;ral light. Inflamed scleral vessels have a crisscross pattern, adhere to the sclera, and cannot be moved with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator.

An immune-&#173;mediated (typically immune-&#173;complex) vasculitis frequently leads to destruction of the sclera and subsequent visual morbidity. Scleritis can occur in association with vari&#173;ous systemic infectious diseases, including syphilis, tuberculosis, herpes zoster, Lyme disease, “cat-&#173;scratch” disease, and leprosy. Metabolic diseases such as gout may also, in rare instances, be associated with scleritis. More than 50% of patients with scleritis have an identifiable associated systemic disease.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Surgically induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS)</span> is characterized by ischemia and sterile scleral inflammation and can occur &#173;after vari&#173;ous ocular surgeries, including pterygium excision with use of mitomycin C, cataract surgery with scleral incisions, and trabeculectomy with use of mitomycin C. SINS is commonly associated with systemic autoimmune diseases.</p>

					<p class="h3">Diffuse versus nodular anterior scleritis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Diffuse anterior scleritis</span> is characterized by a zone of scleral edema and redness. A portion of the anterior sclera (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>50%) is involved in 60% of cases; the entire anterior sclera, in 40% (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-27</span>). In <span class="italic">nodular anterior scleritis,</span> the scleral nodule is a deep violaceous color, immobile, and separated from the overlying episcleral tissue, which is raised by the nodule (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-28">Fig&#160;13-28</span>).</p>
					<p class="h3">Necrotizing scleritis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing scleritis is the most destructive form of scleritis. Ocular and systemic complications occur in 60% of affected patients, vision loss occurs in 40%, and if untreated, a significant percentage of patients may die from complications of vasculitis.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Necrotizing scleritis with inflammation</span> Patients with necrotizing scleritis with inflammation typically pre&#173;sent with severe pain. Most commonly, a localized patch of inflammation is noted initially, with the edges of the lesion more inflamed than the center. In 25% of cases with more advanced disease, an avascular edematous patch of sclera is seen (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-29">Fig&#160;13-29A</span>). A conjunctival epithelial defect may be pre&#173;sent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-29B</span>). Untreated, necrotizing scleritis may spread posteriorly and circumferentially &#173;until the entire anterior globe is involved. Severe tissue loss may result if treatment is not intensive and prompt. The sclera may develop a blue-&#173;gray appearance (due to thinning, which allows the under&#173;lying choroid to show). &#173;After the inflammation subsides, the involved area may reveal an altered deep episcleral blood vessel pattern with large anastomotic blood vessels circumscribing the area.</p>
					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Necrotizing scleritis without overt inflammation</span> Though undoubtedly due to inflammation, this form of scleritis, <span class="h4-text_italic">scleromalacia perforans,</span> is said to be “without inflammation” &#173;because its clinical &#173;presentation is distinct from that of other forms of anterior scleritis, in which typical signs (redness, edema) and symptoms (pain) of inflammation are readily apparent.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Scleromalacia perforans typically occurs in patients with long-&#173;standing rheumatoid arthritis. Signs of inflammation are minimal, and affected individuals typically do not experience pain. As the disease progresses, the sclera becomes thinner and the under&#173;lying dark uveal tissue becomes vis&#173;i&#173;ble (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-30">Fig&#160;13-30</span>). In many cases, the uvea is covered with only thin connective tissue and conjunctiva. Large abnormal blood vessels surround and cross the areas of scleral loss. A bulging staphyloma can develop if intraocular pressure is elevated (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-31">Fig&#160;13-31</span>); spontaneous perforation is rare, although &#173;these eyes may rupture with minimal trauma.</p>
					<p class="h3">Posterior scleritis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> for discussion of posterior scleritis.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The differential diagnosis of scleritis is similar to that of PUK (see &#173;Table&#160;13-4; see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;9</span>, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> for associated diseases). The workup of scleritis therefore includes a complete physical examination, with attention to the joints, skin, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems. It is recommended that the ophthalmologist consult with a rheumatologist or other internist with experience in diagnosing and managing &#173;these conditions. Laboratory studies are guided by the history and findings of the physical examination. However, laboratory tests are generally recommended as an initial screening. If infectious scleritis is suspected, scleral scraping or biopsy can be performed for microbiological analy&#173;sis.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Although topical corticosteroids can be used to alleviate symptoms, the treatment of scleritis is systemic. A guideline for the treatment of patients with scleritis has been proposed by Sainz de la Maza, et&#160;al. It is impor&#173;tant to clearly define treatment goals: treatment failure may be defined as progression of disease to a more severe form (eg, nodular to necrotizing) or failure to achieve a response to treatment &#173;after 2–3 weeks of therapy, in which case a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent therapeutic strategy &#173;will need to be instituted. Idiopathic diffuse and nodular forms of scleritis, which have no ocular complications and &#173;little scleral inflammation, may be responsive to treatment with oral NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, indomethacin). If one NSAID is not effective, another may be substituted.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If the patient is unresponsive to NSAIDs or when inflammation is more severe, &#173;<span class="italic">systemic corticosteroid treatment</span> may be used. To rule out tuberculosis exposure, a &#173;QuantiFERON-&#173;TB Gold test should be considered before initiating systemic immunosuppression with corticosteroids. NSAIDs and &#173;steroids should not be given si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. Prednisone may be started at 1&#160;mg/kg daily and then tapered within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Sustained remission may be obtained with NSAIDs. Systemic corticosteroid treatment should be used with caution in patients with diabetes due to hyperglycemia; comanagement with the patient’s primary care physician or an endocrinologist is recommended. Acid-&#173;reducing medi&#173;cation can be given to patients prescribed NSAIDs or &#173;steroids to reduce the risk of gastritis and ulceration.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If corticosteroid treatment fails or scleral inflammation recurs &#173;after &#173;steroid tapering, systemic immunosuppressive therapy may be considered. &#173;These cases often respond to antimetabolites (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Patients with associated systemic disease, necrotizing scleritis, and/or progressive destructive ocular lesions may require treatment with the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">immunosuppression therapy with antimetabolites:<ul><li class="bullet-sub-list-first _idGenParaOverride-1">T-&#173;cell inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus)</li><li class="bullet-sub-list-first _idGenParaOverride-1">alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide)</li></ul></li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">biologic response modifiers:<ul><li class="bullet-sub-list-first _idGenParaOverride-1">TNF-&#173;<span class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list_greek">α</span> inhibitors (eg, infliximab)</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">anti-&#173;CD20 agents (eg, rituximab)</li></ul></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Antitubercular and anti-&#173;<span class="italic">Pneumocysti</span>s coverage may be necessary for at-&#173;risk patients. Patients receiving systemic treatment should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the administration of &#173;these medi&#173;cations and in the early detection and management of their complications. In addition, it is impor&#173;tant to inform &#173;these patients that close follow-up with an ophthalmologist and partnering physicians is necessary to monitor their disease status and treatment. In patients whose systemic evaluation is initially negative, it is impor&#173;tant to repeat the workup annually.</p>
					<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Scleral reinforcement</span> may at times be required to prevent spontaneous or impending perforation from scleral thinning and ectasia. Ideally, any surgery is performed only &#173;after systemic control of the inflammation or infection has been achieved. The thinned area of sclera may be covered with donor sclera or cornea, autologous periosteum, or fascia lata that is sutured to the adjacent healthier sclera. It is recommended that the patch graft be covered &#173;either by advancing adjacent conjunctiva or using a conjunctival rotation flap, or by an amniotic membrane graft.</p>

					<p class="h3">Complications of scleritis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of scleritis are frequent and include peripheral keratitis (occurring in 37% of cases), scleral thinning (33%), uveitis (30%), glaucoma (18%), and cataract (7%). In sclerokeratitis, the peripheral cornea becomes opacified by fibrosis and lipid deposition in conjunction with adjacent scleritis of varying intensity (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 13-32">Fig&#160;13-32</span>). With progression, the central cornea becomes involved, resulting in opacification of a large segment of cornea. This type of keratitis commonly accompanies herpes zoster scleritis but may also occur in association with rheumatic diseases.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Anterior uveitis may occur as a spillover phenomenon in eyes with anterior scleritis. Some degree of posterior uveitis occurs in all patients with posterior scleritis and may also occur in &#173;those with anterior scleritis. Although one-&#173;third of patients with scleritis have evidence of scleral translucency and/or thinning, frank scleral defects are seen only in the most severe forms of necrotizing disease and in the late stages of scleromalacia perforans.</p>
