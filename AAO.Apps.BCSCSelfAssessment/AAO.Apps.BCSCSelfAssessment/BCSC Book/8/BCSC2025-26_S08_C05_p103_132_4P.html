					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pterygium is a wing-&#173;shaped degenerative fibrovascular growth that extends from the conjunctiva to the superficial cornea (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>). <span class="keypoint_underline">Indications for pterygium excision include ocular discomfort, conjunctival inflammation, decreased vision secondary to induced astigmatism, progression of the pterygium &#173;toward the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-1">Fig&#160;5-1</span>), restricted ocular motility, and cosmesis.</span> The goal of pterygium surgery is to achieve a relatively clear and topographically improved ocular surface. &#173;After excision, the exposed sclera is covered, most commonly with an autologous &#173;free conjunctival graft from the same eye or the fellow eye (Video&#160;5-1). Surgical excision is performed on an outpatient basis. The choice of anesthesia varies according to the degree of involvement and surgeon preference.</p>

					<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Surgical technique</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgical technique for primary pterygium excision can be summarized as follows:</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;A corneal traction suture on a spatulated needle may be placed at the superior limbus, or at the temporal or nasal limbus opposite the pterygium. The traction sutures provide maximal exposure of both the pterygium and the superior bulbar conjunctival harvest site.</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;The pterygium margins are marked with a surgical pen to delineate conjunctival resection margins.</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;The pterygium head on the cornea is dissected from the anterior cornea &#173;toward the limbus (ideally leaving Bowman layer intact).</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;Dissection down to bare sclera is performed at the limbus and extended posteriorly using scissors. Caution is necessary when dissecting Tenon tissue posteriorly &#173;because of the risk of significant bleeding and inadvertent trauma to the under&#173;lying rectus muscle.</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;The pterygium base and under&#173;lying Tenon layer are excised at the conjunctival marks using scissors.</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-mid">6.&#9;&#173;After the excision, pressure is applied to the sclera using a pledget, or light cautery is used for hemostasis. Extensive cautery is preferably avoided. A relatively smooth surface at the dissection site is a desirable endpoint.</p>
					<p class="numbered-list-last">7. The bare sclera can then be covered with a conjunctival autograft (preferably) or by using another technique at the pterygium site.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Techniques for coverage of bare sclera, with fibrin glue or sutures used for fixation, include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">&#173;free conjunctival graft (preferred) from the same eye or fellow eye</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">conjunctival–&#173;limbal autograft</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">amniotic membrane graft</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">conjunctival flap from contiguous tissue</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">&#173;simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Leaving the sclera bare following excision is associated with a higher recurrence rate (32%–88%) than if the sclera &#173;were covered (
					<span class="xref-table" id="Table 5-1"></span>
					<!--<span class="xref-table" id="Table 5-2">&#173;Table&#160;5-2</span>-->
					<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;5-2</span>
					). It also increases the likelihood of postoperative pain, pyogenic granuloma, and scleral melt, as well as corneal complications such as dellen and vascularization.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Covering the entire pterygium excision site decreases postoperative inflammation and speeds reepithelialization of the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="h3">Conjunctival autografts and other techniques for coverage of bare sclera</p>
					<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Covering small to moderate bare areas</span> Following pterygium excision, coverage with conjunctival autograft transplantation using tissue from the superior bulbar conjunctiva is optimal. With a surgical pen, the area to be harvested is marked 0.5–1.0&#160;mm larger than the size of the defect to account for retraction of the graft. It is essential to procure thin conjunctival tissue with only minimal or no Tenon tissue. The harvested material is oriented in the scleral bed so that the limbal side of the graft is adjacent to the cornea in the excision site. A gap of 0.5–1.0&#160;mm is left between the graft and the limbus. The superior bulbar harvest site &#173;under the eyelid can be left bare, or additional conjunctival tissue can be advanced to cover the superior defect. At the conclusion of surgery, some surgeons apply a &#173;bandage contact lens (BCL), which may reduce pain and facilitate healing (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-2">Fig&#160;5-2</span>). <span class="h4-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 5-3">Figure&#160;5-3</span> shows vari&#173;ous types of surgical wound closures &#173;after pterygium excision.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When a &#173;free graft is used, the conjunctival tissue can be secured to adjacent conjunctiva with polyglactin (absorbable) sutures, with or without incorporating episcleral tissue. Alternatively, fibrin glue can be used, which eliminates the need for sutures, reduces surgical time, and decreases postoperative pain and inflammation.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Use of fibrin glue</span> Fibrin glue (also called <span class="h4-text_italic">fibrin sealant</span>) mimics natu&#173;ral fibrin formation and allows for adhesion of the conjunctival graft to the scleral bed. Several fibrin sealants are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are commercially available. Sealants contain pooled &#173;human plasma components, fibrinogen and thrombin. When the 2 components mix, they form a clot that can be used to secure tissue. &#173;These products are approved for colonic anastomoses and hemostasis; currently, their use in pterygium surgery is considered off-&#173;label. Also, &#173;because pooled &#173;human plasma is used to obtain some components of &#173;these sealants, clinicians should be aware of the small potential risk for disease transmission with their use (eg, Creutzfeldt-&#173;Jakob disease).</p>

However, comparative studies showed that conjunctival autograft was superior to amniotic membrane for reducing recurrence. In cases of recurrent pterygium, use of a conjunctival–&#173;limbal autograft lowers recurrence rates. In this procedure, a piece of superior corneal limbus is transferred with adjacent bulbar conjunctiva from the same eye or the fellow eye (Video&#160;5-2). The procedure may be associated with pseudopterygium at the harvest site.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Use of mitomycin C</span> Mitomycin C (MMC) used in association with a conjunctival graft has been shown to reduce the pterygium recurrence rate &#173;after surgical excision (see Table 5-2). However, further studies are necessary to determine the dose and optimal route of administration, as well as the duration of treatment with MMC and its long-&#173;term effects. In vari&#173;ous reports, MMC is applied intraoperatively to the scleral bed at a concentration of 0.2&#160;mg/mL (0.02%) for up to 2 minutes or injected subconjunctivally before surgery. <span class="keypoint_underline">The postoperative use of topical MMC for several days has declined; when employed, it is used with caution &#173;because it can have a toxic effect and may cause visually significant complications such as aseptic scleral necrosis and infectious sclerokeratitis.</span> &#173;These complications may occur months or even years &#173;after use of this agent. For patients undergoing surgery for recurrent pterygium, some surgeons recommend intraoperative MMC. MMC should be thoroughly rinsed intraoperatively &#173;after use.</p>

					<p class="h3">Postoperative care</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After pterygium surgery, topical antibiotic drops are typically used &#173;until reepithelialization occurs and while a BCL is in place. Topical &#173;steroid drops are applied for approximately 4–12 weeks or as needed &#173;until inflammation subsides. Intraocular pressure is monitored regularly. Many recurrences occur in the first few months, and almost all in the first year. The use of bevacizumab in primary pterygium excision has not been reported to reduce the recurrence rate of this condition.</p>
					<p class="h3">Complications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of pterygium excision include conjunctival graft edema, corneoscleral dellen, inadvertent muscle damage, epithelial cysts, and if MMC is used, scleral melting with pos&#173;si&#173;ble infection even years &#173;after surgery. Pyogenic granuloma due to exposed Tenon fibrovascular tissue may also occur, as may chronic nonhealing wounds if exposed sclera remains uncovered by autologous conjunctiva. Per&#173;sis&#173;tent corneal epithelial defect may lead to thinning and perforation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-4">Fig&#160;5-4</span>). Nonhealing corneoscleral wounds should be treated promptly, using &#173;either a BCL or temporary tarsorrhaphy (see the section&#160;Tarsorrhaphy &#173;later in this chapter). Diplopia may result from severe scarring around, or damage to the medial rectus muscle. <span class="keypoint_underline">The medial rectus muscle should be identified at its insertion (5.5&#160;mm from the limbus), and care should be taken to avoid damage to the muscle.</span> Postoperative infections are rare, but cases reported in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture reveal a poor visual outcome; thus, attention to postoperative care is essential.</p>

					<p class="h2">Autologous Conjunctival Transplantation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Autologous conjunctival transplantation (ie, transplantation of the patient’s own conjunctiva) is useful when conjunctival loss is not associated with extensive damage to the limbal epithelial stem cells. Although it is most commonly used in association with pterygium excision, autologous conjunctival transplantation has also been used to treat fornix foreshortening resulting from ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment surgery with a scleral buckle, strabismus surgery, or excision of ocular surface tumors or nevi. Systemic conditions associated with fornix obliteration (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid and Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome) usually affect both eyes, so &#173;there is no ready source of uninvolved conjunctiva. Another indication for conjunctival transplantation is clinically significant pinguecula causing chronic ocular redness and irritation.</p>
					<p class="h2">Conjunctival Flap for Corneal Disease</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conjunctival flap (eg, Gundersen flap) can be used to cover an unstable or painful corneal surface when &#173;there is &#173;little chance of resolution by normal corneal wound healing or other means. A conjunctival flap provides a vascularized tissue cover for the cornea and, although helpful for healing, is not optically clear. Conjunctival flap surgery is performed less frequently than in the past &#173;because of the availability of &#173;bandage and scleral contact lenses, commercial availability of amniotic membrane, use of tarsorrhaphy, and broadened indications for keratoplasty (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span>). Nevertheless, use of the conjunctival flap remains an effective method for managing inflammatory and structural corneal disorders when restoration of vision is not the primary concern. The use of a conjunctival flap is controversial in patients with &#173;either active microbial keratitis or corneal perforation, &#173;because residual infectious organisms may proliferate in the avascular corneal stroma beneath the flap, and a corneal perforation may continue to leak &#173;under a flap.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The principal indications for use of a conjunctival flap are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">chronic, sterile, nonhealing epithelial defects (eg, stromal herpes simplex or herpes zoster keratitis, chemical and thermal burns, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, postinfectious ulcers, neurotrophic keratopathy)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">closed but unstable corneal wounds</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">painful bullous keratopathy in a patient who is not a candidate for keratoplasty</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">a phthisical eye being prepared for a prosthetic shell</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">Some disadvantages of conjunctival flap surgery are a reduced view of the anterior chamber and the creation of a potential barrier to drug penetration through the cornea into the anterior chamber. However, a successful conjunctival graft, &#173;free of buttonholes, &#173;will thin out over time and, if blood vessels regress, may eventually enable some usable vision.</p>

					</ul>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These flaps may be used for temporary coverage of small peripheral corneal wounds or areas of ulceration. The advantage is that only small or partial areas of the cornea are covered; thus, details of the anterior chamber can be visualized, and the patient may regain functional vision. &#173;Because retraction is a common feature of &#173;these temporary flaps, the surgeon should take care to minimize tension on any conjunctival flap when it is placed.</p>
					<p class="h3">Complications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retraction is the most common complication of conjunctival flaps and occurs in approximately 10% of cases. Other complications include hemorrhage beneath the flap and epithelial cysts. In some cases, inclusion cysts enlarge to the point of requiring excision or marsupialization. Buttonholes may enlarge over time, exposing under&#173;lying corneal disease, and should be avoided when pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Ptosis, usually due to levator dehiscence in older adult patients, may also occur postoperatively and may or may not be related to the flap itself. Unsatisfactory cosmetic appearance can be improved with a cosmetic contact lens. In patients with infectious or autoimmune conditions, progressive corneal disease &#173;under any type of conjunctival flap is a concern.</p>
					<p class="h3">Considerations in removal of a flap</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty is to be performed in an eye with a conjunctival flap, the flap may be removed &#173;either as a separate procedure or at the time of keratoplasty. Flap removal (without keratoplasty) usually does not result in vision restoration, as the under&#173;lying cornea is almost always opaque from subepithelial scarring and/or thinning. &#173;Because the conjunctival flap procedure tends to destroy or displace most limbal stem cells, a limbal autograft or allograft &#173;after flap removal may be necessary to provide a permanent source of normal corneal epithelial cells before an optical keratoplasty is attempted.</p>

					<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Conjunctival Biopsy</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conjunctival biopsy can be helpful in evaluating chronic conjunctivitis and unusual ocular surface diseases, including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">squamous lesions of the conjunctiva (eg, ocular surface squamous neoplasia)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">pigmented conjunctival lesions (eg, primary acquired melanosis)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">cicatrizing conjunctivitis (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid; also called <span class="bullet-list_italic">ocular cicatricial pemphigoid</span>)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">conjunctival lymphoid tumors</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">lichen planus</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">pemphigus vulgaris</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h3">Surgical technique</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical anesthetic eyedrops, as well as a pledget soaked with lidocaine 1% or 2%, are applied to the lesion or biopsy site for approximately 30 seconds. Subconjunctival anesthesia (lidocaine 1% or 2% with or without epinephrine) may also be used. The advantages of the lidocaine injection are improved analgesia, blanching of the conjunctival vessels, and reduced bleeding. Forceps and scissors are used to snip a conjunctival specimen sufficient for histologic examination. For cases of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), it is helpful to also submit some normal-&#173;appearing tissue near the lesion (see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>). For a subepithelial lesion, a wedge-&#173;shaped or block-&#173;shaped specimen is excised. Grasping only the edge of the specimen minimizes crushing and preserves tissue integrity. Gentle cauterization can facilitate hemostasis &#173;after the specimen has been removed.</p>
					<p class="reference-first">Liberman&#160;P, Thorne&#160;JE. Conjunctival biopsy. In: Hausheer&#160;JR, ed. <span class="reference_italic">Basic Techniques of Ophthalmic Surgery.</span> 4th&#160;ed. American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology; 2025:133–136.</p>
					<p class="h3">&#173;Handling and transfer of tissue</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Typically, the sample is placed in the proper anatomical orientation on a carrier (eg, filter paper) and inserted into the appropriate fixative, such as 10% neutral-&#173;buffered formalin (for histology), 2.5% glutaraldehyde (for electron microscopy), or Michel or Zeus transport medium (for immunofluorescence microscopy). Tissue wrapped in a gauze pad soaked with balance salt solution may be submitted to the surgical pathologist for immediate pro&#173;cessing if prearranged. To ensure proper &#173;handling and staining of specimens, consulting with the pathologist before surgery is advised. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further details and also for discussion of tissue pro&#173;cessing.</p>
					<p class="h2">Treatment of Conjunctivochalasis</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctivochalasis is characterized by the presence of redundant conjunctival folds positioned between the globe and the lower-&#173;eyelid margin (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>). Surgical procedures used to treat &#173;these redundant folds include superficial cauterization, conjunctival fixation, resection, and amniotic membrane grafting.</p>
					<p class="h3">Superficial cauterization</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A topical anesthetic (eg, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%) is administered. The patient is instructed to look upward and remains in this position throughout the procedure. &#173;After &#173;either topical anesthetic or subconjunctival injection of lidocaine 1% is given, the surgeon grasps the redundant conjunctiva 4&#160;mm from the limbus and cauterizes it, starting with low-&#173;voltage (power level 0.6) bipolar cauterization and gradually increasing the voltage &#173;until the conjunctiva coagulates. Coagulation is considered adequate when the conjunctiva turns white. Coagulation is performed at 5–10 sites in an arc on the inferior bulbar conjunctiva. The slack conjunctiva shrinks and tightens immediately &#173;after coagulation. This procedure can also be done at the slit lamp using topical anesthetic and low-&#173;temperature handheld cautery.</p>

					<p class="h3">Conjunctival fixation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For conjunctival fixation (plication), the lower bulbar conjunctiva is pulled inferiorly, stretched to flatten, and sutured to the inferior sclera with interrupted 6-0 absorbable sutures or 10-0 nylon on a CU-5 needle using episcleral bites inserted 8–10&#160;mm posterior to the limbus. The resulting fold of bulbar conjunctiva must be well below the eyelid margin to prevent the patient from experiencing a foreign-&#173;body sensation &#173;after the procedure.</p>
					<p class="h3">Resection</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgical technique used for resection of the conjunctiva involves making a crescent excision of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva 5&#160;mm from the limbus, followed by excision of redundant tissue and suture closure. A modified sutureless technique involves making 2 small radial incisions on &#173;either side of the area of redundant tissue several millimeters posterior to the limbus. Fibrin glue can be introduced into the subconjunctival space in this area. The redundant tissue is grasped with an angled forceps and gathered to form a ridge, which is then excised. The edges of the wound are pinched together. Excess fibrin can be trimmed (Video&#160;5-6).</p>

					<p class="h2">Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The peripheral corneal epithelium is derived from stem cells residing in the basal layer of the corneal limbus. However, when the limbal stem cells are not functioning properly, the conjunctival epithelium proliferates over the surface of the cornea. As conjunctival cells do not have the pluripotency of limbal stem cells, they cannot differentiate into the corneal phenotype. Thus, replacement of the corneal epithelium by conjunctival epithelium is characterized by surface irregularity and opacity, vascularization, absence of the limbal palisades of Vogt, and poor epithelial adhesion. Impression cytology studies may show goblet cells. This &#173;process is called <span class="italic">corneal conjunctivalization.</span></p>
					<p class="body-text">Minor disturbances to the corneal limbal stem cell function or surface may be reversible with medical therapy using frequent topical lubrication, topical corticosteroid drops, topical cyclosporine, oral doxycycline, punctal occlusion, or a combination of &#173;these modalities.</p>

					<p class="body-text">Mucous membrane grafts increase ocular surface wetting by improving eyelid movement and distribution of the tear film over the cornea, thereby reducing exposure and evaporation. &#173;These grafts also provide a suitable extracellular matrix substrate for epithelial cell migration and adhesion, but they are not effective in replacing normal stem cells.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Mucous membrane grafting can be performed in patients with inactive cicatricial disorders such as late-&#173;stage, nonprogressive Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome and quiescent MMP.&#160;However, mucosa in the mouth is thicker than in the conjunctiva, and any surgical procedure performed in patients with &#173;these disorders can incite severe inflammation. A combination of limbal allograft, amniotic membrane transplantation, and tarsorrhaphy, followed by the use of serum-&#173;derived tears and systemic immunosuppression, helps make ocular surface reconstruction pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Patients with advanced, progressive stage III or IV MMP require advanced immunosuppressive treatment to reduce active inflammation prior to any graft procedure (see the discussion of MMP in Chapter&#160;13). Keratoprosthesis is another treatment option for patients with late-&#173;stage cicatricial disease (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span>), although it is less successful in severely dry eyes.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Multiple surgical techniques for mucosal grafts are available. The reader is encouraged to consult a surgical textbook or video for discussion and illustration of &#173;these techniques (see the reference list below). Potential complications, regardless of the technique, include buttonhole development, graft retraction, trichiasis, surface keratinization of the graft, ptosis, blepharophimosis, depressed eyelid blink, lagophthalmos, submucosal abscess formation, and per&#173;sis&#173;tent nonhealing epithelial defects of the cornea.</p>

					<p class="h2-h1">Superficial Keratectomy and Corneal Biopsy</p>
					<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In superficial keratectomy, the surgeon excises the superficial layers of the cornea (epithelium, Bowman layer, or superficial stroma) without replacing the tissue. Frequently, scraping the surface with a rounded blade alone without excision is sufficient.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The primary indications for superficial keratectomy are</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">removal of hyperplastic or necrotic tissue (eg, pterygium, Salzmann nodular degeneration, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy with scarring, degenerative calcification)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">excision of retained foreign material in the cornea</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">obtaining tissue for diagnostic studies (histologic or microbiologic)</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-last">excision of scar tissue or superficial corneal dystrophic tissue</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="body-text">If corneal biopsy is performed for histologic studies, preservation of tissue integrity and anatomical orientation is impor&#173;tant. A small specimen can be placed on filter paper or a thin card to maintain the tissue orientation before fixation or cryosection. For microbiologic workup, the biopsy specimens can be minced or homogenized before inoculation of the culture media, or they can be prepared for histochemical staining.</p>
					<p class="h3">Surgical techniques</p>
					<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Mechanical keratectomy</span> If the corneal lesion is superficial, it may be pos&#173;si&#173;ble to scrape or peel it away without sharp dissection. Often, the surgeon can obtain a smooth anatomical tissue plane anterior to Bowman layer by using sweeping strokes taken parallel to the tissue while keeping the metal spatula or blade perpendicular to the cornea. Alternatively, a cellulose sponge can be used. In some cases, such as in Salzmann nodular degeneration, the abnormal tissue can be peeled off &#173;gently by using a 0.12 or jeweler’s forceps (see <span class="h4-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>, Video&#160;6-2). When deeper dissection is required, the surgeon can &#173;either mark the area freehand with an adjustable-&#173;depth blade or use a trephine. A 2-mm to 3-mm disposable skin punch or trephine can be used to create a partial-&#173;thickness incision, and forceps and scissors are then used to excise a lamellar flap of cornea. The specimen is generally split into 2 pieces, or separate biopsies are taken, so that tissue can be sent for both histologic and microbiologic examination.</p>

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Phototherapeutic keratectomy</span> Excimer &#173;laser can be used to remove superficial stromal tissue. However, corneal scars or calcium or other deposits may ablate at rates that differ from &#173;those of healthy tissue. An uneven surface can result even when the original surface was smooth. Manual techniques are more likely to re&#173;spect Bowman layer and maintain a smooth ocular surface, unlike the &#173;laser, which does not re&#173;spect anatomical planes. Frequent application of viscous liquid to the corneal surface (as a masking agent) during &#173;laser ablation can fill gaps in the surface and help achieve a smooth surface &#173;after ablation. Most patients experience a hyperopic shift &#173;after phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) due to the corneal-&#173;flattening effect of the procedure. Nevertheless, when manual techniques are not feasible, PTK is an excellent option in patients with superficial (<span class="h4-text_symbol">&lt;</span>100-&#173;<span class="h4-text_greek">µ</span>m deep) stromal scarring or dystrophies. Treatment with PTK may result in postponing or eliminating the need for corneal transplantation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Topical MMC applied to the corneal ablation zone for a brief period following PTK decreases postoperative scar formation. Usually MMC 0.2&#160;mg/mL is applied for 20–30 seconds.

					<p class="h2">Surgical Management of Recurrent Corneal Erosion</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Recurrent corneal erosion results from poor adhesion of the corneal epithelium to the under&#173;lying basement membrane and Bowman layer. This can occur &#173;after traumatic corneal injury, such as that caused by a fingernail scratch, or in association with a corneal dystrophy, such as epithelial basement membrane dystrophy or a dystrophy that results in deposition at the level of the epithelial basement membrane complex (see Chapters&#160;4 and 8). When treatment with hypertonic sodium chloride ointment and drops or a BCL fails to control the erosion symptoms, a surgical approach is warranted. Some clinicians prefer anterior stromal puncture (ASP) for the treatment of traumatic recurrent erosions and epithelial debridement for dystrophic recurrent erosions. ASP can be tried when epithelial debridement is unsuccessful and vice versa.</p>
					<p class="h3">Epithelial debridement</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Removal of the loosely adherent epithelium or an area that contains microcysts, maps, or fingerprint lines can allow healthy surrounding epithelium to fill this defect. The procedure is easily done at the slit lamp &#173;after instillation of topical anesthetic and 5% povidone-&#173;iodine drops. &#173;After insertion of a self-&#173;retaining speculum, a blunt spatula or rounded blade can be used to remove the abnormal area. The surrounding epithelium can be quite loose; it is impor&#173;tant to avoid removing more tissue than necessary. A rounded blade or a diamond burr may be used to &#173;gently remove any remaining epithelial basement membrane, causing mild stromal fibrosis, which may result in stronger adherence of the new epithelium. If this is to be done in the central visual axis, care must be taken not to incise the Bowman layer. Treatment with topical antibiotic, cycloplegic, and corticosteroid, along with a BCL, reduces risk of infection and inflammation and promotes healing. Once the epithelium has healed, continued treatment with hypertonic sodium chloride 5% is often necessary.</p>
					<p class="h3">Anterior stromal puncture</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When recurrent corneal erosions do not respond to medical treatment, ASP can be used and can be performed at the slit lamp (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-10">Fig&#160;5-10</span>, Video&#160;5-9). &#173;After application of topical anesthetic and 5% povidone-&#173;iodine drops, an eyelid speculum is placed. A 25-&#173;gauge or 27-&#173;gauge bent needle is used for puncture of the anterior corneal stroma through the epithelium in the area of loose epithelium. A BCL can be applied &#173;after the procedure and used for several weeks with topical antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment. In the absence of a contact lens, hypertonic sodium chloride 5% ointment may be continued at bedtime.</p>

					<p class="h3">Excimer &#173;laser</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Excimer &#173;laser ablation, &#173;either phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), can be used to induce adherence of the corneal epithelium. However, this may not be the most cost-&#173;effective approach. For a patient hoping to correct both recurrent erosion and refractive error, PRK is appropriate, provided the area of erosion is within the proposed ablation zone. Depending on the type of refractive error, hyperopic PRK or myopic PRK can be performed. PTK can be used as well and has the advantage of a smooth tissue ablation; however, a hyperopic shift may occur, which might be problematic for the patient. Postoperatively, the patient is treated as described in the preceding sections.</p>
					<p class="h2">Management of Per&#173;sis&#173;tent Corneal Epithelial Defects, Thinning, and Perforation</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects are often associated with neurotrophic cornea, they also occur &#173;after chemical injury or moderate to severe infectious keratitis. Reepithelialization of the cornea tends to be slow in the presence of stromal inflammation (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for further discussion). A long-&#173;standing epithelial defect can contribute to chronic inflammation, which can lead to stromal thinning, vision loss, and even perforation.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-9"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>&#173;Factors that may complicate the healing of epithelial defects include</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet">surface disease related to dry eye, conjunctival cicatrization, neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis, or limbal stem cell deficiency</li>
						<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet">chronic exposure due to poor blinking, lagophthalmos, or abnormal eyelid position</li>
						<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet">trichiasis</li>
						<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet">eyelid inflammation</li>
						<li class="clinical-pearl_bullet">corneal edema</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="clinical-pearl_text ParaOverride-10">Correcting or optimizing &#173;these under&#173;lying &#173;factors can be quite helpful.</p>
					<p class="h3">Eyelid taping</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trauma due to the eyelid rubbing against the epithelium during normal blinking may retard reepithelialization. Taping the eyelid closed (ie, patching) on a short-&#173;term basis can be used to manage per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects. Some patients may require part-&#173;time patching with slow tapering to maintain epithelial stability. Proper placement of the patch ensures that it &#173;will not rub against the cornea. Long-&#173;term use of eyelid taping is difficult &#173;because it interferes with the administration of medi&#173;cation, compromises corneal oxygenation, and impairs vision. If pro&#173;gress &#173;toward reepithelialization stops, an alternative &#173;measure is recommended.</p>
					<p class="h3">&#173;Bandage contact lenses</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Application of a thin, oxygen-&#173;permeable, continuous-&#173;wear soft contact lens as a therapeutic &#173;bandage can protect loosely adherent remaining or regenerating epithelium from the rubbing action of the eyelids. Use of BCLs has significantly enhanced the management of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects. &#173;These lenses help reduce stromal leukocyte infiltration and promote regeneration of basement membrane and restoration of tight epithelial–&#173;stromal adhesion without compromising corneal oxygenation, patient comfort, or vision. For comfortable wear, a contact lens with an appropriate base curve is fitted (see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics and Vision Rehabilitation,</span> for more information on contact lens fitting).</p>
					<p class="body-text">Careful consideration is needed in the choice of a soft contact lens for patients with severe dry eye. In general, patients with dry eye have an increased risk of infection with contact lens use. To improve comfort and reduce this risk in &#173;these patients, punctal occlusion can be performed. Contact lenses with high oxygen transmissibility are theoretically the most appropriate choice in patients with dry eye. Lenses should be replaced periodically. Frequent lubrication, antibiotic administration, and close follow-up are impor&#173;tant, especially in patients with decreased corneal sensitivity or dry eyes. The use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended by many clinicians. If a conventional soft lens is not tolerated, an acrylic scleral lens may be a better choice.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Continuous wear of a soft lens can relieve the symptoms of painful bullous or filamentary keratopathy. However, long-&#173;term use of a BCL can also lead to hypoxia, limbal stem cell damage, and vascularization, all of which can compromise the success of &#173;future keratoplasty for vision rehabilitation.</p>
					<p class="body-text">For patients not responding to eyelid taping or BCLs, a lateral or medial tarsorrhaphy, &#173;either temporary or permanent, may be considered. The tarsorrhaphy procedure is described &#173;later in this chapter.</p>
					<p class="h3">Treatment of corneal thinning and descemetocele</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of dellen, resulting from focal stromal dehydration, is a potential cause of corneal thinning that can occur when tear film is unevenly distributed. Dellen typically appear at the limbus next to an area of elevated or edematous conjunctiva. An epithelial defect may be pre&#173;sent (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-11">Fig&#160;5-11</span>). Short-&#173;term eyelid taping or a BCL is helpful. Addressing the under&#173;lying cause is necessary for recurrent dellen.</p>

The condition is typically due to stromal infection or sterile inflammation and signals that the patient is at risk for corneal perforation.</span> Deep radial folds are commonly observed &#173;toward the area of extreme thinning. The descemetocele may also bulge forward into the cornea. The goals of therapy are to treat the infection and inflammation while facilitating reepithelialization, in an effort to prevent perforation.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>Patients with descemetoceles should be counseled to seek medical care if they experience a gush of fluid or increased tearing, as this may indicate perforation.</p>
					<p class="body-text ParaOverride-11">The first order of therapy for descemetocele is to use appropriate antibiotics and anti-&#173;inflammatory medi&#173;cations. Topical &#173;steroids may reduce inflammation but also may potentiate breakdown of collagen. A BCL or even tarsorrhaphy may facilitate reepithelialization. In patients with under&#173;lying autoimmune conditions and sterile peripheral ulcerative keratitis, adequately treating the systemic disease is essential. Some clinicians use oral doxycycline as a protease inhibitor. Conjunctival resection in the area of a peripheral melt may arrest keratolysis and promote reepithelialization. Application of cyanoacrylate glue is helpful in treating impending perforation; the key is to use the glue sparingly. A BCL is typically applied.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Use of an amniotic membrane graft is an alternative treatment for a sterile melt. The graft is cut to the shape of the defect and placed as a patch over the descemetocele. The patch may be held in place with a larger amniotic membrane graft that is sutured or held in place with fibrin glue. With time, scar tissue reinforces the deficient area and may reduce the need for keratoplasty.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some corneal perforations are small and seal spontaneously before ophthalmic examination, with no intraocular damage, iris prolapse, or adherence. In such cases, only systemic and/or topical antibiotic therapy, along with close observation, may be needed. If a corneal wound is leaking but the anterior chamber remains formed, the leakage may be sealed through a combination of pharmacologic suppression of aqueous production (using a topical ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cation or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), eyelid taping, and/or a BCL. The wound can be sealed with cyanoacrylate glue (see <span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;5-4B, 5-14</span>). Perforations larger than 2&#160;mm are usually not amenable to tissue adhesive and require a tissue patch graft (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-13</span>).

					<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Use of cyanoacrylate glue</span> Although cyanoacrylate glues are not FDA approved for ophthalmic use, they are widely used and have a long track rec&#173;ord for safety and efficacy in sealing impending or small (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>2&#160;mm) perforations. Cyanoacrylate glue applied to thinned or ulcerated cornea may prevent further thinning and can prevent leakage during the healing &#173;process. &#173;After the lesion is sealed, corneal vascularization and scar formation helps to ensure the integrity of the area by providing nutrients and antiproteases.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">surgical technique</span> Cyanoacrylate glue can usually be applied on an outpatient basis using topical anesthetic. The procedure should be performed &#173;under a surgical scope or at the slit lamp for proper visualization. However, if adherent or prolapsed uvea in the leakage site or a flat chamber is encountered, the procedure may be best performed in the operating room using balanced salt solution and/or viscoelastic to re-&#173;form the anterior chamber. An eyelid speculum is necessary to keep the eyelids open and immobilized, and the area is dried with a cellulose sponge. The glue &#173;will not adhere well to necrotic tissue or loose epithelium.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The fluid adhesive is applied to the corneal wound by using the tip of a 30-&#173;gauge needle or anterior chamber cannula; often, a small drop or two of the glue is sufficient to seal the perforation. Excess glue should be avoided as it may dislodge and increase the size of the perforation. &#173;Because the glue does not polymerize on plastic, an alternative way to apply the adhesive is to spread a small amount on a section of sterile plastic wrapping taken from any medical product and cut into a 3-mm to 4-mm disk shape using a skin trephine. The plastic disk is attached with ointment to the wooden tip of a cotton swab (Video&#160;5-10). The glue polymerizes completely within 20–60 seconds and usually adheres well to the deepithelia&#173;lized surface (Fig&#160;5-14; see also Fig&#160;5-4B).</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="keypoint_underline">Tarsorrhaphy—&#173;the surgical joining of the upper and lower eyelid margins—is performed to reduce the exposed surface area of the cornea. It is among the safest, most effective, and most underutilized procedures for healing difficult-&#173;to-&#173;treat corneal lesions.</span> Tarsorrhaphy is performed most often to protect the cornea from exposure caused by inadequate eyelid coverage, as may occur in neurotrophic cornea, thyroid eye disease, or facial nerve dysfunction such as Bell palsy. It can also be used to aid in the healing of indolent corneal ulceration, as sometimes occurs with tear film deficiency, herpes simplex virus infection or zoster, or stem cell dysfunction.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Tarsorrhaphies are classified as lateral (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-15">Fig&#160;5-15</span>), medial, or central and as temporary or permanent according to the position of the adhesion of the eyelids and the desired duration of the adhesion. &#173;Because the cosmetic effect of a tarsorrhaphy is significant, patients may be reluctant to undergo this procedure and should be counseled on its therapeutic benefits. Eyelid anatomy and surgical technique for tarsorrhaphy are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery</span>.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The Frost suture is a temporary eyelid closure involving the use of a transtarsal plate suture to keep the eyelids closed without intramarginal adhesion; it can be employed to partially occlude the eyelids for up to 2–3 weeks (Video&#160;5-11). Eye examination can be performed through the nasal or temporal opening (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-16">Fig&#160;5-16</span>). A releasable knot may be placed to allow periodic assessment.</p>

					<p class="body-text">For temporary tarsorrhaphies, tissue does not need to be removed. Plastic bolsters can be used to protect the eyelids from tight sutures (see Fig&#160;5-16). Alternatively, small incisions can be made in the eyelid skin for buried absorbable sutures, which can reduce patient discomfort due to the sutures. Fi&#173;nally, a vertical mattress suture of 6-0 nylon can be placed in the tarsi of the upper and lower eyelids through the eyelid margin and tied temporally or nasally. The suture can remain in place for 2 weeks.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A tarsorrhaphy can be opened using local anesthesia in the office. If the status of the corneal exposure is uncertain, the tarsorrhaphy can be opened in stages, a few millimeters at a time. If the tarsorrhaphy has been performed properly, eyelid margin deformity is minimal.</p>
					<p class="h3">Alternatives to tarsorrhaphy</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Injection of botulinum toxin A into the levator palpebrae superioris muscle to paralyze its function can cause pharmacologic ptosis and, mimicking surgical tarsorrhaphy, can impart a protective effect that may last several months. Application of cyanoacrylate adhesive (discussed &#173;earlier in this chapter) to the eyelid margins may also result in temporary joining of the eyelids. It is impor&#173;tant to avoid inadvertent application of glue to the cornea. In both procedures, the surgeon cannot control how long the effect &#173;will last.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Tape may also be used to join the eyelids temporarily; however, it rarely adheres for longer than 24 hours and irritates the skin. Use of moisture-&#173;retaining eyewear <span class="italic">(moisture chamber glasses)</span> is another temporary &#173;measure that may be used to minimize desiccation and help protect the ocular surface. &#173;These devices are available commercially or may be constructed with plastic wrap and taped over the eyelids.</p>

					<p class="h2">Corneal Tattooing</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal tattooing has been used for centuries to improve the cosmetic appearance of a blind eye with an unsightly leukoma (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-17">Fig&#160;5-17</span>). It has also been used occasionally in seeing eyes to reduce the glare from scars and to eliminate monocular diplopia in patients with large iridectomies, traumatic iris loss, and congenital iris colobomas (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 5-18">Fig&#160;5-18</span>). For small iris defects, applying a marking pen to the cornea over the affected area can simulate the effect of tattooing. Although the effect is temporary, this practice enables patients to experience the effect of the procedure.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Dif&#173;fer&#173;ent techniques may be used to create a tattoo. One involves applying a platinum-&#173;ion solution to the cornea. When this solution reacts with a second agent, a black precipitate is formed in the cornea, producing a dark deposit that can simulate a pupil. Another technique involves adapting standard methods used in skin tattooing to the corneal setting: applying a paste of colored pigment (&#173;either India ink or a metal oxide) to the cornea and then using a hypodermic needle or angled blade to drive the pigment into the corneal stroma in the area that needs coverage. Multiple superficial punctures are made &#173;until enough pigment has been applied; additional pigment colors can be used to give a more natu&#173;ral appearance. However, the method is time-&#173;consuming and often needs to be repeated if pigment uptake is inadequate or the pigment migrates. Pigment application &#173;under a corneal lamellar flap created by a microkeratome or femtosecond &#173;laser can be performed with or without lamellar keratoplasty (Video&#160;5-13).</p>
