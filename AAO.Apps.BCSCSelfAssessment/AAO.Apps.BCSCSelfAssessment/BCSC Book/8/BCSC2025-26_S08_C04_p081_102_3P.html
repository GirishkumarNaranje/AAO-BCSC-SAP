					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The stability and refractive function of the ocular surface are maintained by a close relationship among the eyelids, conjunctiva, and corneal epithelium. When any part of this triad is disturbed, the ocular surface is compromised, resulting in significant ocular comorbidities. This chapter considers each ele&#173;ment of this triad along with the pertinent associated conditions.</p>

						<p class="h2-h1">Floppy Eyelid Syndrome</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is an ophthalmic disease consisting of chronic ocular inflammation and characterized by a lax upper tarsal plate that everts with minimal digital elevation and upward force applied to the eyelid. Clinical findings include small to large papillae on the upper palpebral (tarsal) conjunctiva, mucous discharge, and corneal involvement ranging from mild punctate epitheliopathy to superficial vascularization (<span class="h5-text_xref-figure xref-figure" id="Fig 4-1">Fig&#160;4-1</span>). Common symptoms include redness, foreign-&#173;body sensation (FBS), and mucous discharge that is most prominent upon waking. Clinical signs include bulbar and superior conjunctival hyperemia, upper-&#173; and lower-&#173;eyelid laxity, and often an obese habitus.</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Eyelid laxity in FES may result in spontaneous eversion of the upper eyelid when the patient sleeps face down; eyelid eversion allows the superior palpebral conjunctiva to come into contact with the pillow or bed linens. Subsequent contact of the superior palpebral conjunctiva with the ocular surface can result in trauma to the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva, inducing inflammation and chronic ocular irritation. The condition is usually bilateral but can be asymmetric or unilateral if the patient tends to sleep on one side. The syndrome is most frequently observed in patients with obesity, who often also have obstructive sleep apnea. Keratoconus (discussed in Chapter&#160;9) has also been reported in patients with FES. The differential diagnosis for FES includes vernal conjunctivitis, &#173;giant papillary conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, and toxic keratopathy.</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment consists of applying ointment to the eye at night and &#173;either protecting the affected eye with a shield or taping the eyelids closed at night to prevent eyelid eversion. If symptoms persist, a surgical procedure can be performed to tighten the upper eyelid to manage the condition; see BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="h5-text_italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery</span>. Patients with FES should be evaluated for sleep apnea and may want to consider a sleep study.</p>

						<p class="h2">Distichiasis and Trichiasis</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> In patients with <span class="h5-text_italic">distichiasis,</span> an extra row of eyelashes emerges from the meibomian gland orifices. &#173;These eyelashes may be fine and well tolerated or coarse and a threat to corneal surface integrity (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-2">Fig&#160;4-2A</span>). Symptoms include conjunctival redness, FBS, tearing, and mucous discharge. Clinical signs may be minimal, but punctate staining can be observed in areas where the lashes contact the cornea. In <span class="h5-text_italic">trichiasis,</span> eyelashes arise from their normal anterior origin but curve inward &#173;toward the cornea (Fig&#160;4-2B).</p>
						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Distichiasis is a congenital (often autosomal dominant) or acquired condition, whereas trichiasis is acquired. Trichiasis can be idiopathic, due to involutional eyelid changes, or secondary to serious chronic inflammatory conditions. Entropion (inward rotation of the upper or lower eyelid and lash line) due to involutional changes can lead to trichiasis. <span class="keypoint_underline">More serious conditions such as mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), chronic ocular graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease, chronic blepharitis, and toxic conjunctivitis cause cicatricial changes to the conjunctiva and the eyelid margin, with subsequent trichiasis, and must be ruled out.</span> In older adults, MMP often pre&#173;sents early in the disease &#173;process as trichiasis. Early recognition and treatment of MMP at this stage can preserve vision and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Hallmarks of the disease are subconjunctival fibrosis of the palpebral conjunctiva, foreshortening of the conjunctival cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac, and symblepharon.</p>

						<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Just as poor eyelid position should be corrected, so should aberrant eyelashes, especially when &#173;there is ocular surface compromise. Aberrant eyelashes may be removed by mechanical epilation, electrolysis with a radiofrequency probe (also known as <span class="h5-text_italic">hyfrecation</span>), ablation with an argon &#173;laser, or cryotherapy. Mechanical epilation provides only temporary relief &#173;because the eyelashes normally grow back in as soon as 3 weeks. Electrolysis works well for removing only a few eyelashes; however, it may be preferable in youn&#173;ger patients for cosmetic reasons. Cryotherapy is still a common treatment for aberrant eyelashes, but freezing can result in eyelid margin thinning, loss of skin pigmentation, loss of adjacent normal eyelashes, and per&#173;sis&#173;tent lanugo (fine hairs), which may continue to abrade the cornea. It is impor&#173;tant to limit treatment at <span class="h5-text_symbol">−</span>20°C to minimize complications. The preferred surgical technique for aberrant eyelashes due to marginal cicatricial entropion is tarsotomy with eyelid margin rotation. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="h5-text_italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery,</span> for additional discussion of trichiasis and cicatricial entropion.</p>

					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory condition involving the superior palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, as well as the superior limbus and cornea.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Symptoms of SLK can include ocular irritation, light sensitivity, and FBS. Vision is not usually affected. SLK is often bilateral but can be asymmetric. The condition can be associated with aqueous tear deficiency or blepharospasm. Ocular findings may include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="bullet-list-first">hyperemia and thickening of the superior bulbar conjunctiva</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">hypertrophy of the superior limbus</li>
						<li class="bullet-list-mid">fine punctate fluorescein, lissamine green, or &#173;rose bengal staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva that extends above the limbus, with involvement of the superior cornea adjacent to the limbus (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-3">Fig&#160;4-3A</span>)</li>

					<p class="body-text">SLK is more frequently seen in &#173;women and may recur over a period of 1–10&#160;years. SLK is associated with thyroid disease. In 1 study, 90% of patients with SLK had some type of thyroid-&#173;related ophthalmopathy; 49% required orbital decompression. Therefore, SLK is a prognostic indicator for thyroid eye disease.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis of SLK has not been established, but the condition is thought to result from repetitive mechanical trauma occurring with blinking, in which tight upper eyelids rub against superior bulbar conjunctiva, which often demonstrates laxity and hypermobility in patients with SLK. In addition, SLK has been associated with graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease and has been observed following blepharoplasty. It can also be associated with conjunctivochalasis<span class="h5-text_italic">.</span></p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Hyperproliferation, acanthosis, goblet cell loss, and keratinization are observed in histologic sections of the superior bulbar conjunctiva. SLK can often be diagnosed clinically. However, scrapings or impression cytology of the superior bulbar conjunctiva showing characteristic features of nuclear pyknosis with “snake nuclei,” an increased epithelial cytoplasm–&#173;nucleus ratio, goblet cell loss, or keratinization may be helpful in the diagnosis of mild or confusing cases. It is recommended that patients with SLK undergo thyroid function tests, including &#173;free thyroxine (T<span class="CharOverride-1">4</span>), thyrotropin (TSH), and thyroid antibodies.</p>

The redundant conjunctival folds rest on the lower-&#173;eyelid margin, and punctate staining may be observed. The surface disruption is presumably caused by conjunctival tissue chafing against itself with movement of the eye. This tissue may roll on or over the eyelid margin or cover the lacrimal punctum, obstructing tear outflow. Affected patients may be predisposed to recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages. The severity of symptoms in conjunctivochalasis can range from mild to marked (see Fig&#160;4-4).</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis has not been established but may be similar to that of SLK (see the section&#160;Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis).

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> It is reasonable to try topical lubricants, topical antihistamines, a short course of topical corticosteroids, or patching the eyelids closed nocturnally. Cauterization of the redundant folds is sometimes effective. Alternatively, the clinician may consider excision of excess conjunctival tissue to relieve the chronic ocular irritation and the obstruction of the lacrimal punctum, thereby restoring tear drainage (see Fig&#160;4-4).

					<p class="h2-h1">Exposure Keratopathy</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> When corneal sensation is normal, the symptoms of exposure keratopathy are similar to &#173;those of evaporative dry eye and include FBS and photophobia. Exposure keratopathy is characterized by punctate epithelial erosions that usually involve the inferior one-&#173;third of the cornea; however, in severe cases, the entire corneal surface may be involved. Large, coalescent epithelial defects may result, possibly leading to infectious or sterile ulceration and occasionally perforation. Exposure in the presence of a neurotrophic cornea or corneal anesthesia is an ophthalmic emergency &#173;because of the increased risk of corneal ulceration and stromal melt (see the section&#160;Neurotrophic Keratopathy, &#173;later in this chapter).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Exposure keratopathy can develop as a result of proptosis or any condition associated with poor blinking or lagophthalmos, which is defined as incomplete lid closure. </p>

					<p class="body-text">When the prob&#173;lem is likely to be long-&#173;standing, surgical management most commonly consists of permanent lateral and/or medial tarsorrhaphy (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>); of note, the cosmetic effect of a tarsorrhaphy is significant. Insertion of gold or platinum weights into the upper eyelid is an effective, more cosmetically pleasing approach to facilitate eyelid closure. Reported complications of gold weight implants include infection, implant malposition, extrusion, induced astigmatism, unacceptable ptosis, and noninfectious inflammatory response to the gold. The weights remain stable during magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, correction of any associated eyelid abnormalities, such as ectropion, entropion, and/or trichiasis, is indicated. In cases of paralytic ectropion of the lower eyelid, a horizontal tightening procedure may also be beneficial.</p>

The round or oval erosions frequently have elevated gray-&#173;white edges of “heaped-up” epithelium, which are associated with under&#173;lying stromal inflammation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-5">Fig&#160;4-5</span>). Left untreated, per&#173;sis&#173;tent corneal epithelial defects can pro&#173;gress to vascularization and corneal opacification or corneal thinning and pos&#173;si&#173;ble perforation. Secondary bacterial keratitis may also occur in affected patients.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Neurotrophic keratopathy is typically caused by damage to CN V or to the branches of CN V that innervate the cornea, resulting in corneal hypoesthesia or anesthesia. Healthy innervation of the cornea has a trophic effect on the epithelium, lacrimal gland, and meibomian glands that is necessary for an optimal corneal surface. Vari&#173;ous ocular and systemic conditions can affect CN V or its branches and subsequently result in neurotrophic keratopathy (

					<span class="h5-text_xref-table xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-2</span>
					). One common cause of neurotrophic keratopathy is herpetic keratitis, which can be associated with per&#173;sis&#173;tent or recurrent corneal epithelial defects or chronic punctate keratopathy in the absence of replicating virus or active inflammation. A neurotrophic cornea can also occur following keratoplasty, &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery, or surgery near the CN V nucleus (eg, gamma knife radiotherapy for temporomandibular joint pain). Diabetic neuropathy is also a cause of neurotrophic keratopathy and nonhealing epithelial defects.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Management of neurotrophic keratopathy with or without per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects begins with eliminating or limiting the use of potentially aggravating topical medi&#173;cations, especially &#173;those containing preservatives. Also, patients often need frequent reminders to avoid touching the ocular surface, as this trauma can affect healing of the keratopathy. Frequent lubrication with preservative-&#173;free drops, gels, or ointments and autologous serum drops (20%–50%), which contain growth &#173;factors and fibronectin, may be useful. In cases involving considerable dry eye, temporary or permanent punctal occlusion may be effective in improving the volume and stability of the tear film and restoring the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">For years, eyelid taping in conjunction with ophthalmic ointments has been the mainstay of treatment of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial defects. Low-&#173;water-&#173;content BCLs (soft, thin, highly oxygen-&#173;permeable lenses) or scleral contact lenses with a fluid-&#173;filled reservoir have shown efficacy in facilitating reepithelialization or improving keratopathy in the short term in patients who are not surgical candidates. Scleral lenses can also help maintain the ocular surface over the long term in &#173;these patients.</p>
					<p class="body-text">In cases associated with stromal melting, a medi&#173;cation with specific activity against matrix metalloproteinases, such as a tetracycline administered orally, may help prevent or arrest keratolysis. Topical recombinant &#173;human nerve growth &#173;factor, cenegermin 20 <span class="greek">μ</span>g/mL (Oxervate) administered 6 times daily for 8 weeks, has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy. Some patients experience eye pain in the course of this treatment. Amniotic membrane transplantation has been reported to promote healing of per&#173;sis&#173;tent epithelial erosions. Lateral and/or medial tarsorrhaphy with or without a conjunctival pillar may be required to prevent ocular surface desiccation. Tarsorrhaphy, &#173;whether temporary or permanent, decreases the exposed ocular surface, thereby reducing tear film evaporation and protecting against external insults. Partial or total Gundersen conjunctival flap surgery can prevent keratolysis; however, due to the permanent nature of this procedure, it is typically used as a last resort. Corneal neurotization, or transposition of intact nerve branches to the subconjunctival space near the limbus in the affected eye, is a recent surgical technique designed to reestablish corneal sensation in neurotrophic corneas.

					<p class="h2">Recurrent Corneal Erosion</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">recurrent erosion syndrome (RES)</span> classically refers to a recurrent epithelial disruption (abrasion) that is often incited by traumatic corneal injury (eg, due to a fingernail, paper cut, or tree branch) or occurs secondary to under&#173;lying epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD) with poor epithelial adhesion.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Erosions that are not classically considered RES have other etiologies. Identifying the causative etiology is necessary to determine treatment. In anterior stromal dystrophies, subepithelial deposits can disrupt the epithelial basement membrane complex, resulting in poor adherence of the epithelium. In patients with endothelial dystrophies, stromal edema develops, which places stress on the epithelial basement membrane and can predispose to recurrent corneal erosions (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Corneal edema due to endothelial disruption can also cause microcystic edema or bullous keratopathy, which may result in recurrent corneal abrasions with FBS that is typically worse in the morning, when the cornea is most edematous.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Patients pre&#173;sent with a sudden onset of eye pain, which typically occurs during sleep or upon first awakening, accompanied by FBS, redness, photophobia, and tearing.</p>
					<p class="clinical-pearl ParaOverride-3"><span class="sidebar2-head"><span class="sidebar-text_bold">Clinical Pearl</span></span><span class="sidebar2-head"> </span>In patients with recurrent erosion syndrome (RES), the initial epithelial abrasion and occasionally subsequent erosions can heal rapidly, at times with no clinical evidence of damage pre&#173;sent on examination. A good history and high index of suspicion can facilitate diagnosis of RES.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Erosions can recur days or even years &#173;later, often without any obvious precipitating event. Episodes usually last from 30 minutes to several hours. More severe episodes may last for several days and are often associated with greater pain, extreme photophobia, eyelid edema, or decreased vision. Patients often experience ocular discomfort without observable pathology.</p>

					<p class="body-text"><span class="keypoint_underline">Slit-&#173;lamp examination using a broad oblique beam with direct, indirect, or retroillumination can help identify irregular epithelium. Fluorescein can show epithelial irregularities in areas of erosions (see</span><span class="keypoint_underline"> </span><span class="keypoint_underline">Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-4). In patients with under&#173;lying EBMD, epithelial cysts or fingerprint lines can be seen in the affected eye as well as the fellow eye (see</span> <span class="keypoint_underline">Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-1).</span> The presence of dystrophic changes in the epithelium of the unaffected eye suggests a primary basement membrane abnormality as the root cause, whereas the absence of such findings in combination with a corroborating history may indicate a posttraumatic etiology (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-6">Fig&#160;4-6</span>).</p>

When a patient is examined &#173;after the acute episode has resolved, recurrent erosions may be hard to identify.

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Recurrent erosions are caused by disruption of the epithelial basement membrane complex, possibly from damage to the hemidesmosomes that anchor the epithelium to the under&#173;lying stroma. This results in a lack of epithelial adherence and an increased likelihood of an epithelial defect. The corneal epithelium is loosely attached to the under&#173;lying basement membrane and Bowman layer, both at the time of a recurrent attack and between attacks, when the cornea appears to be entirely healed.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Traditional therapy for the acute phase of RES consists of taping the eyelids shut, along with topical antibiotic ointments and cycloplegia, followed by the use of nonpreserved lubricants, or hypertonic saline solution or ointment (sodium chloride 5%) during the day and sodium chloride hypertonic ointment 5% at bedtime. This regimen is typically continued for at least 6 weeks to protect and facilitate epithelial attachment and repair hemidesmosomes. Hypertonic agents may transiently produce an osmotic gradient, drawing fluid from the epithelium and, theoretically, promoting the adherence of epithelial cells to the under&#173;lying tissue. Some patients find hypertonic medi&#173;cations unacceptably irritating, whereas many patients do well with this therapy in&#173;def&#173;initely. The use of low-&#173;dose oral doxycycline and short-&#173;term use of topical corticosteroids to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases have been effective in treating some patients with recurrent erosions.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A BCL may be used as an alternative to eyelid taping in the short term, but it is a less desirable option for long-&#173;term management. Proper patient education about the risks associated with contact lens wear and the importance of judicious monitoring during contact lens use is crucial to a successful outcome. The ideal BCL fits without excessive movement and has high oxygen transmissibility (Dk). New-&#173;generation soft contact lenses with lens-&#173;surface treatments that decrease bacterial adherence may offer a better safety profile than older lens designs. Concomitant use of a topical broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic 2–4 times daily may reduce the possibility of secondary infection but may also increase the risk of toxicity and bacterial &#173;resistance over the long term. Alternatively, large-&#173;diameter scleral contact lenses can provide a precorneal fluid reservoir that is effective in treating patients with chronic RES. Patients with intractable recurrent corneal erosions despite the above treatment modalities may benefit from protecting the affected eye with a rigid shield during sleep.</p>
					<p class="body-text">When consistent conservative management fails to control symptoms, surgical therapy may be indicated and includes epithelial debridement and anterior stromal puncture (ASP). Some clinicians prefer to use debridement for central erosions or erosions related to corneal dystrophies, and stromal puncture in patients with posttraumatic recurrent erosions. Diamond burr superficial keratectomy has been used to treat recurrent erosions, but it can result in irregular astigmatism if the treatment is too aggressive. &#173;Because diamond burr and ASP are occasionally associated with visually significant anterior stromal scarring, some clinicians prefer &#173;laser ablation for areas of recurrent erosion within the central visual axis. Excimer &#173;laser ablation may be performed with &#173;either phototherapeutic keratectomy or photorefractive keratectomy. It is impor&#173;tant to caution patients undergoing phototherapeutic keratectomy about the possibility of induced refractive error.

					<p class="h2">Dellen</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dellen are saucerlike depressions in the corneal surface caused by focal stromal dehydration. Desiccation of the corneal epithelium and subepithelial tissues occurs at or near the limbus, adjacent to conjunctival surface elevations such as &#173;those associated with pterygium, recess-&#173;resect procedures, or in the presence of large filtration blebs. Normal blinking does not wet the involved area properly &#173;because the tear film is interrupted by &#173;these surface elevations. &#173;After an active blink, a transient &#173;bubble that temporarily displaces the tear film may be observed overlying the dellen. This can cause a dysesthesia that enhances the development of dellen.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Nonpreserved artificial tear therapy alone is effective only in rare cases. The use of viscous lubricants and ointments or a BCL may help restore the focal desiccation of the cornea. Taping the eyelids shut followed by frequent topical lubrication is most effective in rapidly restoring stromal hydration, although resolution of the conjunctival surface elevation may be necessary for permanent resolution of dellen.</p>
					<p class="h2">Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular surface is composed of populations of epithelial cells, which are regularly replaced by proliferation from a distinct subpopulation of cells known as <span class="italic">stem cells.</span> Corneal stem cells reside in the basal cell layer of the limbus, whereas conjunctival stem cells may be uniformly distributed throughout the bulbar surface and the fornices (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Stem cell deficiency of the cornea can be found in several ocular surface disorders. <span class="keypoint_underline">A whorl-&#173;like irregularity of the ocular surface emanating from the limbus is typical. The whorled epithelium is best seen when a patient is examined a few minutes &#173;after topical fluorescein instillation (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-8">Fig&#160;4-8</span>). Neovascularization may be pre&#173;sent in the involved cornea.</span> Another sign of limbal stem cell deficiency is loss of architecture of the palisades of Vogt (see <span class="h5-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>). Recurrent ulceration and decreased vision may develop in some patients &#173;because of the irregular corneal surface.</p>

					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> To ensure normal ocular surface healing, approximately 25%–33% of the limbus must remain intact. The normal limbus acts as a barrier to prevent neovascularization extending from the conjunctiva and invasion of conjunctival cells from the bulbar surface. When the limbal stem cells are congenitally absent, injured, or destroyed, conjunctival cells migrate onto the ocular surface (conjunctivalization), often accompanied by surface irregularity and superficial neovascularization (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-9">Fig&#160;4-9</span>). The absence of limbal stem cells reduces the effectiveness of epithelial wound healing, which may contribute to an irregular ocular surface and recurrent epithelial breakdown.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Stem cell deficiency can result from both primary and secondary &#173;causes. An example of a primary cause is aniridia (<span class="italic">PAX6</span> pathogenic variant [mutation]). Secondary &#173;causes include chemical burns, thermal burns, radiation exposure, contact lens wear, and cicatricial conjunctivitis (eg, MMP, Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome, ocular graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease). Other &#173;causes are listed in

					.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> In mild or focal cases associated with local &#173;factors such as contact lens or topical medi&#173;cation use, the inciting cause should be discontinued. In addition to topical lubrication and/or punctal occlusion, medi&#173;cations such as topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine, and oral doxycycline can be helpful. In some cases, a scleral contact lens may improve vision and protect the ocular surface.</p>
					<p class="body-text">If the stem cell deficiency is focal or sectoral, the abnormal epithelium can be debrided to promote resurfacing of the denuded area with adjacent, healthy stem cells. Care must be taken to avoid further decompensation of the ocular surface.</p>

					<p class="h2">Toxic Ocular Surface Reactions to Topical Ophthalmic Medi&#173;cations</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical &#173;presentation</span> Punctate staining of the corneal or conjunctival epithelium, erosive changes, and subepithelial corneal infiltrates all suggest a direct toxic reaction to topical medi&#173;cation. Mucopurulent discharge and conjunctival injection with a follicular response are signs of an acute toxic reaction. Mild to severe papillary reaction may indicate chronicity. Occasionally, the discharge is copious and mimics bacterial conjunctivitis. Infrequently, a monocular reaction occurs despite the medi&#173;cation being applied to both eyes.</p>
					<p class="body-text">More severe cases of toxic keratitis can pre&#173;sent with a diffuse punctate epitheliopathy, occasionally in a whorl pattern called <span class="italic">vortex</span> or <span class="italic">hurricane keratopathy</span>. The most severe cases may pre&#173;sent with a central or inferior corneal epithelial defect, stromal opacification, and neovascularization, which may be compounded by extensive damage to the limbal stem cells. This can result from prolonged use of preserved topical medi&#173;cations or agents that block fibroblast proliferation (eg, mitomycin C).</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Toxic ocular surface disease can occur as a complication of exposure to vari&#173;ous substances (

					<span class="h5-text_xref-table xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-4</span>
					). Epithelial keratopathy secondary to topical ophthalmic medi&#173;cation use can result in a dose-&#173;dependent cytotoxic effect on the ocular surface. One of the most common toxic ingredients in &#173;these preparations is the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK). Corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells absorb and retain preservatives; residual amounts of preservative are detectable in the corneal epithelium days &#173;after a single application of a topical preserved medi&#173;cation. This condition is sometimes referred to as <span class="h5-text_italic">toxic ulcerative keratopathy.</span></p>
					<p class="body-text">In some cases, pseudodendritiform lesions and pseudogeographic defects occur. &#173;These clinical findings are often misinterpreted as a worsening of the under&#173;lying disease and thus may lead to more frequent dosing of the offending medi&#173;cation.

					<p class="body-text">Mitomycin&#160;C, even when used with care, has been associated with prolonged, irreversible stem cell damage with a resultant chronic keratopathy. If this agent is used in a low concentration (<span class="symbol">≤</span>0.4&#160;mg/mL) and applied only to the surgical site via a cellulose surgical sponge (as in trabeculectomy or pterygium excision), followed by copious irrigation, the risk of limbal stem cell damage is believed to be reduced.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Toxic keratitis that manifests as peripheral corneal infiltrates in the epithelium and anterior stroma, with a clear zone between the lesions and the limbus, is typically associated with the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, antiviral agents, or medi&#173;cations preserved with BAK or thimerosal.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Chronic follicular conjunctivitis generally involves both the upper and the lower palpebral conjunctiva but is usually most prominent inferiorly. Bulbar follicles are uncommon but, when pre&#173;sent, are highly suggestive of a toxic etiology (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-10">Fig&#160;4-10</span>). The medi&#173;cations most associated with toxic follicular conjunctivitis are presented in &#173;Table&#160;4-4. Inferior punctate epithelial erosions occasionally accompany toxic follicular conjunctivitis.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Contact lens solutions can also cause severe epithelial damage and pain when contact lenses soaked in cleaning or preservative-&#173;laden solutions are inadvertently placed in the eye without rinsing. The alkaline cleaning material or preservative (often thimerosal) can cause chemical injury of the cornea.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Asymptomatic subconjunctival fibrosis is sometimes associated with the long-&#173;term use of topical ophthalmic drugs (eg, miotics, <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers); however, in a small minority of affected patients, a more severe type of progressive subconjunctival scarring develops, which can lead to contraction of the conjunctival fornix, symblepharon formation, punctal stenosis, and corneal pannus formation.</p>
					<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment of ocular toxicity requires that the offending topical medi&#173;cations be discontinued. Severe cases may take months to resolve completely; thus, failure of symptoms and signs to resolve within days to a few weeks may be consistent with the under&#173;lying toxic etiology. Patients experiencing significant ocular irritation may find relief by using nonpreserved topical lubricant drops or ointment. It is impor&#173;tant to emphasize that toxic reactions to ocular medi&#173;cations can lead to irreversible changes, for example, conjunctival scarring and/or shrinkage.</p>
					<p class="body-text">A conjunctival biopsy showing the characteristic diffuse, nonlinear immunofluorescent staining that confirms antibody deposition would typically indicate the diagnosis of the autoimmune disease MMP rather than drug-&#173;induced scarring (ie, pseudopemphigoid). <span class="keypoint_underline">However, even in patients with MMP, a conjunctival biopsy result can be negative in up to 50% of cases.</span> Withdrawal of the medi&#173;cation is generally followed by a lag of weeks before progressive scarring can be stabilized (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>); MMP would be expected to pro&#173;gress over time.</p>

					<p class="h2">Toxic Corneal Epithelial Cell Reactions to Systemic Cancer Medi&#173;cations</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many classes of cancer medi&#173;cations can affect the corneal surface. Due to the rapid turnover of epithelial cells, drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis may be toxic to the corneal epithelium when used systemically in high doses. For example, cytarabine, used in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia, can cause punctate keratopathy and refractile epithelial microcysts, which are associated with pain, photophobia, FBS, and reduced vision.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Antibody-&#173;drug conjugates (ADCs), a relatively new class of anti-&#173;cancer therapeutics, contain a monoclonal antibody tethered to a cytotoxic drug (“payload”) through a chemical linker. All ADCs can cause new-&#173;onset dry eye, and some of &#173;these drugs cause microcyst-&#173;like epithelial changes, which can lead to dry eye symptoms; decreased vision; and with prolonged use, limbal stem cell dysfunction (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-11">Fig&#160;4-11</span>). Eye care providers need to manage patients receiving ADCs in partnership with oncologists, as &#173;these patients often require an eye examination before each dosing. Treatment consists of supportive care with artificial tears, topical &#173;steroids, and vasoconstrictors and a dose hold or dose adjustment when patients have significant ocular adverse effects.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Other classes of medi&#173;cations, such as checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been reported to cause significant ocular surface inflammation, keratitis, cicatricial conjunctivitis, and corneal perforations. Checkpoint inhibitors cause ocular surface inflammation via T-&#173;cell activation, whereas tyrosine kinase inhibitors are thought to primarily affect epithelial cell proliferation and maintenance. As &#173;these newer classes of medi&#173;cations are approved for a wide variety of cancer therapies, our understanding of their effect on the ocular surface continues to evolve, and all systemic therapies must be taken into consideration as a pos&#173;si&#173;ble cause of new-&#173;onset ocular surface disease.</p>

					<p class="h2">Self-&#173;Induced Ocular Surface Disorders</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyes with self-&#173;induced ocular surface disorders usually show evidence of mechanical injury to the inferior and nasal quadrants of the cornea and conjunctiva. The areas of involvement display sharply delineated borders. The conjunctival tissues usually show no evidence of inflammation on pathologic examination.</p>
					<p class="h3">Mucus fishing syndrome</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mucus fishing syndrome is characterized by a well-&#173;circumscribed pattern of &#173;rose bengal or lissamine green staining on the nasal and inferior bulbar conjunctiva. All patients have a history of increased mucus production as a nonspecific response to ocular surface damage. The inciting event is typically keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Patients usually demonstrate vigorous eye rubbing and compulsive removal of strands of mucus from the fornix (mucus fishing). The resultant epithelial injury heightens the ocular surface irritation, which in turn stimulates additional mucus production, resulting in a vicious cycle.</p>
					<p class="h3">Topical anesthetic misuse</p>
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical application of topical anesthetics to facilitate an ophthalmic examination is an integral part of ophthalmology. However, indiscriminate use of topical anesthetics can cause serious ocular surface toxicity and complications. Health care workers and other individuals with access to topical anesthetics may be more likely to misuse &#173;these agents, as may patients given topical anesthetics for at-&#173;home use &#173;after treatment in an urgent care setting for eye trauma. Topical NSAIDs can also cause ocular surface anesthesia. Local anesthetics are known to inhibit corneal epithelial cell migration and division. Loss of microvilli, reduction of desmosomes and other intercellular connections, and swelling of mitochondria and lysosomes have been reported in ultrastructural studies. The characteristic clinical feature of anesthetic misuse is a failure of the presenting condition, for example, corneal abrasion or keratitis, to respond to appropriate therapy.</p>
					<p class="body-text">Initially, a punctate keratopathy is observed. As the misuse continues, the eye becomes more injected, and epithelial defects develop, with heaped-up or rolled edges suggestive of neurotrophic keratopathy (see Fig&#160;4-5). As the &#173;process continues, keratic precipitates and hypopyon develop, thus mimicking an infectious etiology. Common presenting signs at an advanced stage include diffuse stromal edema, dense stromal infiltrates, and a large ring opacity (<span class="xref-figure" id="Fig 4-12">Fig&#160;4-12</span>). Stromal vascularization may occur with long-&#173;term misuse, and infection or even perforation may ensue. &#173;Because of the presence of corneal infiltrates and anterior segment inflammation, it is impor&#173;tant to consider the possibility of infectious keratitis and to evaluate the eye with corneal scraping, culture, or biopsy as needed.</p>
					<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal, herpetic, and amebic keratitis. Suspicion of anesthetic misuse is warranted in any patient with negative culture results who does not respond to appropriate therapy. In suspected cases, a trial of patching the eyelids closed, with the patch appropriately labeled to detect removal, may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. Often, the condition is diagnosed only when the patient is discovered concealing the anesthetic drops. Once the diagnosis is made and the offending anesthetics are removed, corneal healing usually ensues. Psychiatric counseling may be helpful.</p>
